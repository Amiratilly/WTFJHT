1/ **The Justice Department argued that Trump could continue to profit from foreign governments visiting his hotel in Washington, D.C.** if he didn't explicitly provide something in return. A federal judge criticized the argument that Trump's financial interest in the Trump International Hotel in D.C. is constitutional. The lawsuit, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland, claims that Trump's profits from the hotel violate the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government employees from receiving financial benefits outside of their official salary. The judge promised to decide by the end of the July whether to allow the case to proceed to the next stage.

2/ **Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump earned at least $82 million in outside income while serving as Trump's advisers during 2017.** Kushner reported more than $5 million in income from a Kushner Cos. apartment complex in Plainsboro, N.J. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-and-ivanka-trump-made-at-least-82-million-in-outside-income-last-year-while-serving-in-the-white-house-filings-show/2018/06/11/a41d0720-6dab-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cc17e4068a68))

3/ **Ivanka Trump personally made $3.9 million last year from her stake in the Trump International Hotel**. She made an additional $5 million from businesses connected to her personal brand, as well as roughly $2 million in 2017 in pay and severance from the Trump Payroll Corp. Her reported income from the hotel in 2017 was much higher than it was last year, when she reported about $2.4 million in income since it opened in September 2016.

4/ **Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee want to interview Ivanka Trump** as part of the investigation into Russian election interference. The committee wants to interview Ivanka about "two separate national security questions." Sen. Ron Wyden said investigators should ask about her role in connecting a Russian weightlifter, Dmitry Klokov, with Michael Cohen. Klokov offered to connect her father to Putin in order to facilitate building a Trump Tower in Moscow. \[^1\] The other issue Wyden said investigators should ask about is China's decision to grant Ivanka trademarks around the same time her father promised to help Chinese telecom manufacturer ZTE stay in business.

5/ **The Senate blocked Trump's deal with Chinese telecom giant ZTE.** The Senate's move comes less than a week after Trump struck a deal with ZTE that would keep the company in business with U.S. companies and markets. \[^2\] The ZTE deal would have forced the company to pay $1 billion in penalties, reorganize itself, and insert U.S. compliance officers into the company in exchange for access to U.S. consumers. ZTE is considered by the U.S. intelligence community to be a mechanism for espionage by selling phones that can be tracked and enabled to steal intellectual property.
