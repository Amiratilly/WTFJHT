1/ **Sen. Jeff Flake will vote "yes" on Kavanaugh's confirmation**, ensuring that the Senate Judiciary Committee will advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. Flake said that he still has "much doubt" after yesterday's hearings with Kavanaugh and Ford, but he believes "our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence ... absent corroborating evidence."

* **The White House can't say "for certain" that they have enough Senate votes to confirm Kavanaugh**. "We're getting there," Raj Shah said.

2/ **Leaked emails show a Republican aide declined to take phone calls from Deborah Ramirez and her legal team**, who alleges that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party in college.

Mike Davis, the senior Republican committee staffer, demanded that Ramirez produce evidence in written form before any conversation about her testifying would be allowed to proceed.

3/ **The American Bar Association called on the Senate to postpone a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation until the FBI can complete an investigation into Ford's allegations of sexual assault**.

The ABA previously gave Kavanaugh its highest rating of unanimously "well-qualified" for the Supreme Court.

## Notables.

1. **A Russian-born American businessman who donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump's presidential campaign offered to brief a high-ranking official during the waning months of the campaign.** A series of emails reveal that Houston oil executive Simon Kukes bragged about his connections to the Trump campaign and requested a face-to-face meeting with Vyacheslav Pavlovsky, vice president of the state-owned Russian Railways and a former Russian ambassador to Norway. Kukes donated $273,000 to the Trump Victory Committee during the 2016 campaign, and later sent a photo of himself posing with Rudy Giuliani to Khodorkovsky, saying "I was at a dinner with Donald Trump." He added: "I think his chances are very good." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/big-donor-trump-campaign-made-overture-top-russian-official-boasting-n913791))

2. **The Trump administration released an environmental impact statement that predicts the earth's temperature will rise by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.** The administration did not offer the forecast as an argument to fight climate change, instead offering the analysis as evidence that the fate of the planet is already sealed. The draft statement was issued as justification for Trump's decision to freeze fuel efficiency standards for vehicles built after 2020.
