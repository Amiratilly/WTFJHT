1/ **Trump ‚Äì again ‚Äì denied the rape allegations against him by E. Jean Carroll, claiming she is "totally lying" and "not my type."** Carroll accused Trump of pushing her up against a dressing room wall and raping her in a department store in 1995 or 1996. Trump accused Carroll of making up the story, because "I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is ‚Äî it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that." Carroll is the 16th woman to have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault or misconduct ‚Äî all of which he has denied.

* **üìå [Day 883](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/06/21/day-883/#4-trump-rejected-an-allegation-by-jo): Trump rejected an allegation by journalist E. Jean Carroll that he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the 1990s**, saying that he has "never met this person in my life." According to Carroll, she met Trump inside Bergdorf Goodman when he told her he was buying a gift for "a girl" and needed help. While in the lingerie section, Carroll said Trump suggested a lace bodysuit, and encouraged her to try it on. "The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll [writes](https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html). "He seizes both my arms and pushes me up against the wall a second time, and, as I become aware of how large he is, he holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights." More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump, meanwhile, said: "Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda."

2/ **The New York Post's former top editor deleted a story about E. Jean Carroll's rape allegations against Trump**. Col Allan, a Trump supporter and top Rupert Murdoch lieutenant, ordered the story to be scrubbed from the website on Friday, as well a wire story by the Associated Press. Allan returned to the paper in early 2019, reportedly in an effort to make the paper even more friendly to Trump. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/media/new-york-post-col-allan-trump/index.html) / [New York Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-new-york-post-rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-20190625-6e5pmsm3mjeqzjqumz23h23a7m-story.html))

3/ **Congress is trying to pass a $4.5 billion in emergency humanitarian aid to the southwestern border while putting restrictions on Trump's immigration policies**. In the Senate, Republicans and Democrats approved a $4.6 billion border aid package last week that contained some limitations to prevent the administration from using the resources for enforcement. The House bill allocates $4.5 billion, but goes further in placing restrictions on the money. Democrats in the House, however, are still concerned that any money they approve will be directed by the Trump administration to advance Trump's immigration policies. The Trump administration, meanwhile, threatened to veto the House measure, claiming it "does not provide adequate funding to meet the current crisis" and "contains partisan provisions designed to hamstring the administration's border enforcement efforts."

4/ **Health and Human Services said it will run out of money in July for sheltering migrant children**. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said a situation to a government shutdown would result if the program isn't funded, with workers and companies caring for the children without pay. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-24/azar-says-u-s-is-running-out-of-money-to-shelter-migrant-kids))

* **Border Patrol is rejecting donations of toys, soap, toothbrushes, diapers and medicine for children held in "horrendous," overcrowded facilities**. Under the Antideficiency Act, the government can't spend any money or accept any donations other than what Congress has allocated to it. ([Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/24/texas-border-facility-donations-turned-away/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/24/conditions-migrant-detention-centers-are-deplorable-trump-pence-blame-democrats/) / [Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/border-patrol-refusing-donations-migrant-children-soap-and-toothpaste.html))

* **üìå [Day 834](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/05/03/day-834/): John Kelly joined the board of a company that operates the largest facility for unaccompanied migrant children**. Caliburn International is the parent company of Comprehensive Health Services, which operates Homestead and three other shelters for unaccompanied migrant children in Texas. Prior to joining the Trump administration, Kelly had been on the board of advisors of DC Capital Partners, an investment firm that now owns Caliburn.

5/ **Iran called Trump's White House "mentally retarded" and promised that Iran wouldn't be intimidated by new, "fruitless sanctions."** Iran's Foreign Ministry also said Trump's leadership would lead to "the permanent closure of the road of diplomacy" between the two countries. Trump meanwhile, threatened that any attack by Iran would be answered with "great and overwhelming force" and in some cases, "overwhelming will mean obliteration." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/world/middleeast/iran-rouhani-us-sanctions.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/iran-says-white-house-sanctions-1380320) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/trump-says-u-s-will-use-overwhelming-force-if-iran-attacks) / [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-us-sanctions-trump-ali-khamenei-nuclear-deal-middle-east-a8973316.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-says-path-to-diplomacypermanently-closed-following-us-sanctions/2019/06/25/636b48e6-96b7-11e9-9a16-dc551ea5a43b_story.html?utm_term=.8f974a4074bf))

6/ **Trump claimed he has the authority to initiate a military strike against Iran without congressional approval**, but said he likes "the idea of keeping Congress abreast." Speaker Nancy Pelosi asserted that Trump would need congressional approval for any "hostilities" against Iran. Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, however, believes that Trump's authority to take military action against Iran falls within his executive power, but outside the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/450117-trump-i-do-not-need-congressional-approval-to-strike-iran) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/politics/trump-congressional-approval-iran/index.html))

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-top-commerce-aide-says-he-was-directed-by-ross-to-add-census-citizenship-question/2019/06/24/4ba75f2c-96d2-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/commerce-house-panel-questions-1380209))

3. **Trump has been frequently snapping at Mick Mulvaney and expressing more frustration with him than usual**, revealing a slow deterioration of their relationship. Trump has recently asked people what kind of leadership and value they think Mulvaney is adding. Trump, however, is unlikely to replace his acting chief of staff ‚Äì his third chief of staff in less than two-and-a-half years ‚Äì anytime soon. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/trump-mick-mulvaney-white-house-1379594))

4. **The Treasury Department's inspector general will open an investigation into why Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin delayed the new $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman**.

5. **The White House directed Kellyanne Conway to reject a request to testify before the House Oversight Committee about her repeated violations of the Hatch Act**, a federal ethics law that bars government officials from engaging in political activities at work.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

1. **Trump declined to say if he has confidence in FBI Director Christopher Wray**. When asked about his level of confidence in Wray, Trump replied: "Well, we'll see how it turns out." Trump added that he disagrees with the FBI director, who previously said he does not believe the bureau "spied" on Trump's 2016 campaign.

2. **Trump is privately considering withdrawing from a defense treaty with Japan**. Trump claimed the pact is too one-sided, because it guarantees U.S. aid if Japan is ever attacked, but doesn't require Japan's military to do the same for America. The treaty was signed more than 60 years ago and constitutes the foundation of the post-war alliance between the two countries after World War II.
