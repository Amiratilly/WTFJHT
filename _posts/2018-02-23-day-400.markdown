1/ **Rick Gates will plead guilty to conspiracy and making false statements and will cooperate with Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election**, according to a letter Gates gave to family and close friends. Gates' plea indicates he plans to admit to taking part in a conspiracy to hide tens of millions of dollars he and Paul Manafort obtained for their lobbying and consulting work related to Ukraine. Gates could offer incriminating information against Manafort or other members of the Trump campaign in exchange for a lighter punishment.

4/ **Trump suggested that armed teachers should get a "bit of a bonus" for carrying a gun in the classroom**. The White House indicated that the U.S. could find the money to arm and train up to a million teachers with guns. Trump said arming teachers would be a "great deterrent" to would-be killers, and suggested that up to 40 percent of teachers could be given a bonus of $1,000 if they agree to carry a weapon and undergo training to make them "gun adept." The White House said the plan, if implemented, would involve distributing a total of roughly $1 billion to a million teachers across the country.
