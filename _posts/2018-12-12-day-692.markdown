1/ **Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison** for tax evasion, violating campaign finance laws, lying to banks and to Congress. Cohen apologized for his conduct, admitting that he had arranged the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal "for the principal purpose of influencing the election" for president in 2016, and took "full responsibility" for covering up the "dirty deeds" out of "blind loyalty" to Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty in two separate cases: One brought by Robert Mueller over his lies to Congress. The other was brought by the southern district of New York over tax and bank fraud, and campaign finance violations. Cohen blamed Trump for his "path of darkness." In addition to the prison time, Cohen will forfeit $500,000 in assets and pay $1.393 million in restitution.

* **Trump blamed the crimes stemming from paying Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were Cohen's fault**. "Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me," Trump tweeted. "Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!" Cohen said he arranged the payments at Trump's behest. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-10/trump-says-any-crime-committed-in-paying-hush-money-was-by-cohen?srnd=politics-vp))

* **Stormy Daniels was ordered to pay Trump nearly $293,000 for his attorneys' fees** and another $1,000 in sanctions after her defamation suit against him was dismissed. Earlier this year Daniels filed a defamation lawsuit, claiming Trump acted with "actual malice" and "reckless disregard for the truth" when he mocked her claim that she was threatened by an unknown man to keep silent about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.

2/ **National Enquirer's parent company admitted that it paid Karen McDougal $150,000 in an attempt to influence the 2016 election** as part of a non-prosecution cooperation agreement that American Media Inc. entered into with the Southern District of New York. David Pecker, a Trump ally and CEO of AMI, met with Cohen "and at least one other member of the campaign" in August of 2015, offering "to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided." AMI paid McDougal for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump, which was never published.

3/ **Michael Flynn asked to be spared jail time because of his "extensive cooperation" with Mueller**. Flynn pleaded guilty last December to lying to the FBI during its counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He blamed the FBI agents for tricking him into lying by not warning him that "that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview." Flynn asked to receive a year of probation and 200 hours of community service in light of his cooperation, long service in the U.S. military, and his lack of a criminal record. Mueller's office similarly recommended little to no jail time last week because he had provided "substantial assistance" in the investigation that "likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming."

* **Everyone who's been charged as part of the Mueller investigation**. The special counsel has issued more than 100 criminal counts against 33 people and three companies. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/21/us/mueller-trump-charges.html))

4/ **The incoming New York attorney general plans to launch a wide-ranging investigations into Trump, his family, and "anyone" in his orbit who may have violated the law**. Letitia James plans to investigate any potential illegalities involving Trump's real estate holdings in New York, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, government subsidies Trump has received, whether he used his businesses to violate the emoluments clause, and the Trump Foundation. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/incoming-new-york-attorney-general-plans-wide-ranging-investigations-trump-n946706))

* **Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are poised to benefit financially from the Opportunity Zone tax break they pushed Trump to pass.** Opportunity Zones provide tax breaks to developers who invest in depressed American communities. Watchdog investigators say the pair are navigating an ethical minefield after becoming two of Trump's closest advisers without divesting from their real estate investments. The couple owns stakes in at least 13 properties held by Kushner's family firm that could now qualify for tax breaks because they are in Opportunity Zones in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/41847c1548e34d0ba8c339836b86ed93))

* **Rudy Giuliani continues to seek lucrative security consulting contracts with foreign governments while representing Trump** as part of his work for Giuliani Security and Safety. Giuliani is not a government employee and is not subject to government ethics rules. His security consulting contracts include clauses stipulating that he will not lobby on behalf of clients before the U.S. government. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/giuliani-consulting-abroad.html))

* **The targets of U.S. sanctions are trying to hire lobbyists with connections to Trump in order to help them reduce or get out of those sanctions entirely.** Some of the biggest payments to Washington's influence industry have gone to lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants with connections to Trump or his administration, a notion that reeks of the pay-to-play corruption often seen in the politics of many African, Asian, Middle Eastern, and former Soviet nations. "People overseas often want to hear that you know so-and-so, and can make a call to solve their problem," said a leading Washington sanctions lawyer. The trend has been encouraged by Trump administration officials who project Trump's willingness to make deals around sanctions and tariff exemptions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html))

5/ **Trump claimed he is not concerned about impeachment after it was [reported](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/11/day-691/#4-trump-sees-impeachment-as-a-real-p) that Trump sees impeachment as a "real possibility."** He then defended the payments he directed Cohen to make to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, saying "It's hard to impeach somebody who hasn't done anything wrong and who's created the greatest economy in the history of our country." Trump added: "I'm not concerned, no. I think that the people would revolt if that happened." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-exclusive-idUSKBN1OB01N))

## Notables.

1. **The next chief of staff needs to win the approval of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump**. The two have their sights set on Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, who they see as extremely loyal. Mnuchin, however, remains uninterested in the position. "There was no Plan B" after Nick Ayers refused to take the job, Steve Bannon said. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that 10 to 12 people who want the chief of staff job "badly," but the understanding is that Trump has essentially been "just calling around to friends" to try and fill the position. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-staff-exclusive-idUSKBN1OB08G) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/12/trump-white-house-chief-of-staff-search-ivanka-jared-1059163) /  [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/there-was-no-plan-b-trump-scrambles-to-find-chief-of-staff-after-top-candidate-turns-him-down/2018/12/10/9b6d0424-fc9c-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html))

2. **Trump doubled down on his decision to stand by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite his own CIA's assessment that MBS ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.** "He’s the leader of Saudi Arabia," Trump said during an interview. "They’ve been a very good ally." Trump continued to defend MBS by reiterating that the "crown prince vehemently denies" any involvement in Khashoggi's death. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-saudi-exclusive-idUSKBN1OB01C))

3. **Despite no evidence linking terror attacks in the U.S. to illegal immigration, Trump used the attack in France to again argue for more funding for his border wall**. "Another very bad terror attack in France," Trump tweeted. "We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!"
