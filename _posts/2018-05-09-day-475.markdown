1/ **A report from the Senate Intelligence Committee concludes that Russia conducted an "unprecedented, coordinated cyber campaign" in order to undermine confidence in U.S. voting systems** starting as early as 2014 through Election Day 2016. Senators report that the Russians targeted at least 18 states looking for vulnerabilities, and in six states they tried to gain access to voting websites. In "a small number of states" actually breached election computer defenses. The committee said it found no evidence that vote tallies or voter registration information were changed, but that Russian hackers were "in a position to, at a minimum, alter or delete voter registration data."

2/ **Top White House officials withheld information sought by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes**, siding with senior FBI and national intelligence officials that the information could endanger a top-secret intelligence source. The decision marks a rare moment of agreement between the White House and the Justice Department. After the White House and Justice Department refused the request, Nunes publicly suggested that he may try to hold Jeff Sessions in contempt for refusing to comply. Some administration officials worry that Trump will change his mind and support Nunes' argument that "Congress has a right and a duty to get this information."

3/ **One of the women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct has won her primary bid for state office in Ohio**. Rachel Cooks accused Trump of kissing her without her consent in 2005 and went public with her claims in 2016. She is now the Democratic nominee for a seat in the Ohio state Legislature. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/rachel-crooks-ohio/index.html))

4/ **Trump mused about taking away press credentials from media outlets over "negative" coverage of him**. "Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt?" Trump tweeted. "Take away credentials?" Trump was apparently responding to a segment on Fox and Friends, which cited a [study](https://twitter.com/theMRC/status/993948062518267904) from the Media Research Center â€“ a right-wing media watchdog. The study says 91% of network news stories about him are negative.
