1/ **The Trump administration will withhold federal funding for family planning clinics that provide abortions or refer patients to places that perform them** in a change to how Title X family planning funds are awarded. The rule will resurrect a Reagan-era policy that requires abortion services to have "separate personnel" and require a "bright line" of "physical separation" from other family planning services. Title X serves about 4 million women a year and costs taxpayers about $260 million.

2/ **Trump tweets: The Justice Department put "an embedded informant" inside his campaign in order to "spy" on him in an effort to "frame" him "for crimes he didn't commit."** Giuliani tried to clarify Trump's tweets, saying the president doesn't "know for sure" if there was an FBI informant in his campaign. He added that Trump's legal team was told "off the record" that there was not one informant but two informants. Trump tweeted that if the reports are true, then it would be the "all time biggest political scandal!" He called the allegations "really bad stuff!"

3/ **Rudy Giuliani said Robert Mueller agreed to limit the scope of a potential interview with Trump to two topics instead of five**. Mueller, according to Giuliani, is not interested in Michael Cohen or his business dealings. "The main focus we want is Russia," Giuliani said, adding: "The President would testify tomorrow if it was about the truth. The truth is he had nothing to do with Russia. The President is not going to lie."

4/ **Giuliani: Mueller's appointment was "really about the firing of Comey."** He added that a president can commit obstruction of justice, contradicting Trump's now-former lawyer John Dowd, who said "the president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer." But, according to Giuliani, Comey's firing wouldn't count as obstruction – regardless of Trump's reason for doing so – because Comey was "replaced by somebody else on an acting position immediately."

5/ **Summer School: Trump's lawyers are planning a series of summer prep sessions for a possible sit-down interview with Mueller**. The planning meetings will be held during off-hours at the White House and will mirror his 2016 debate preparation, where aides briefed Trump in short sessions over many weeks.

6/ **Michael Cohen's suspicious activity reports aren't missing – the Treasury Department has restricted access to them**. Earlier this week, a law enforcement official admitted to leaking some of Cohen's banking records over concerns they had been removed from a Treasury Department database as part of a cover-up. The official could only access one SAR related to Cohen, but knew that two more should have been available. The Treasury Department also restricted some law enforcement agencies from accessing the database despite memorandums of understanding that allow agencies, including the DEA, the FBI, and the IRS, to access the information.
