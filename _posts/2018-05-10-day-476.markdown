1/ **Mike Pence: It's time for Robert Mueller to "wrap it up" because it's "been about a year since this investigation began."** He added that the Trump administration has "fully cooperated" with the probe, which Trump has frequently referred to as a "witch hunt." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-says-its-time-for-special-counsel-to-wrap-up-russia-investigation/2018/05/10/88e17d4e-544a-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/2c48454c665c4f43bfabaf13a495d660) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/mike-pence-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html))

2/ **The Russia-linked company that hired Michael Cohen registered a number of alt-right websites during the 2016 elections**. Columbus Nova is listed as the registrant behind a handful of website domains named them after the alt-right movement, including Alt-right.co, Alternate-right.com, Alternate-rt.com, Alt-rite.com, and others. The brother of Andrew Intrater, Columbus Nova's U.S. CEO, is named in the registration databases for the websites.

3/ **Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released 3,500 Facebook ads purchased by a Russian troll farm** from mid-2015 to mid-2017. The ads, from the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, reached at least 146 million people on Facebook and Instagram, spreading inflammatory and divisive messages on immigration, race, gun control, Islam, LGBT-centric topics, and more, in an attempt to polarize Americans. Facebook's targeting tools allowed the Russian agents to deliver their disinformation to targeted groups of users with specific geographic, age range, gender, and interests.

Schiff [said in a statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/10/here-are-the-3400-facebook-ads-purchased-by-russias-online-trolls-during-the-2016-election/).

5/ **John McCain gave the Steele dossier to then-FBI director James Comey**. "I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as 'the dossier,'" McCain writes in his [new book](https://amzn.to/2rwalbK). "I reviewed its contents. The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation's security should have done." McCain concludes: "I did what duty demanded I do."

6/ **Trump's pick to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, claimed during her Senate confirmation hearing that the CIA "never did" interrogations "historically."** The claim is demonstrably false, but CIA spokesman Dean Boyd came to Haspel's defense, saying Haspel meant that the CIA "did not have...a detention and interrogation program" before 9/11. Senators were visibly frustrated with Haspel's refusal to answer questions about whether she believes torture is immoral. McCain called on the Senate to reject Haspel's nomination, citing her refusal to acknowledge "torture's immorality."
