1/ **A ten-year-old girl died in September 2018 while in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.** She was the first of six migrant children that have died while detained by U.S. authorities. Rep. Joaquin Castro accused the Trump administration of concealing the girl's death from the public. "I have not seen any indication that the Trump administration disclosed the death of this young girl to the public or even to Congress," Castro said. "And if that's the case, they covered up her death for eight months, even though we were actively asking the question about whether any child had died or been seriously injured. We began asking that question last fall."

2/ **A lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives against Trump's national emergency declaration will be allowed to move forward.** The suit argues that Trump's decision to use a national emergency declaration to transfer money from appropriated accounts to fund the construction of his border wall violates the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to determine how taxpayer money should be spent. The case will be heard in federal court today in Washington, D.C. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/house-lawsuit-national-emergency-declaration/index.html))
