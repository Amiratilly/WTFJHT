1/ **Mitch McConnell blocked two House-passed bills that would have ended the now-20-day-long government shutdown.** McConnell refused to take up the Senate versions of bills advanced by the House to reopen the parts of the government that have been shut down since late last month. McConnell has said that he will not consider any bills related to the shutdown that he doesn't believe Trump would sign. He added: "Political stunts are not going to get us anywhere."

2/ **The Pentagon has started preparing options to build a wall along the southern border in the event that Trump declares a national emergency.** "The Department of Defense," said Navy Capt. Bill Speaks, "is reviewing available authorities and funding mechanisms to identify options to enable border barrier construction." Trump once again warned that he was considering using an emergency declaration if talks with Democrats ultimately fail to result in an agreement. "If this doesnâ€™t work out, probably I will do it â€“ I would almost say definitely," Trump said. "We have plenty of funds if thereâ€™s a national emergency."

3/ **Michael Cohen agreed to voluntarily and publicly testify in front of the House Oversight Committee before he goes to prison next month.** Trump's former personal attorney said he appreciates the opportunity "to give a full and credible account of the events that have transpired" during the time that he worked for Trump. Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings said the committee is "in the process of consulting with Special Counsel Muellerâ€™s office," and promised more information about the Feb. 7 hearing in the coming weeks. Cohen will also answer questions from lawmakers about the Russia investigation during a closed-door session before the committee "in the near future," according to Adam Schiff.

4/ **Robert Mueller asked for information directly last year from one of Trump's campaign pollsters who also used to do business with Paul Manafort.** Campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio was interviewed by Mueller's team in February 2018, a meeting that was previously unreported. The interview is even more significant in light of recent revelations that Mueller has been investigating how Manafort shared polling data with an associate who had ties to Russian intelligence.

* ðŸ“Œ **[Day 719](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/page/2/#2-paul-manafort-gave-2016-polling-da): Paul Manafort gave 2016 polling data to a former employee with ties to Russian intelligence services.** The exchange was inadvertently revealed when Manafort's lawyers failed to fully redact Manafort's interview with Robert Mueller in a court filing. Manafort's attorneys meant for Mueller's line of questioning to remain private, but the text in question was easily readable when opened with a word processor.

### Notables.

1. **Scientists say the oceans are warming at a much faster rate than they thought.** A new study published in the journal Science found that the oceans are heating up 40% faster on average than estimates by a U.N. panel published just five years ago. The rising temperatures are killing off marine wildlife and ecosystems and the rising sea levels are making hurricanes more destructive. As the oceans continue to heat up, the impacts of those effects will become catastrophic. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/climate/ocean-warming-climate-change.html))

2. **Steve Mnuchin agreed to give a classified briefing to members of Congress about his decision to lift sanctions on companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska**. The briefing came after the chairs of seven House committees sent a letter to the Treasury Secretary and former Trump campaign finance chair demanding to know more about the decision.

3. **Trump canceled a trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum** and blamed it on "the Democrats \[*sic*\] intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/trump-davos-world-economic-forum.html))
