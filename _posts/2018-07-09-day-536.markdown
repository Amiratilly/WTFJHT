1/ **Trump says he is "very close to making a decision" on his Supreme Court nominee**. Aides, however, have prepped rollouts for multiple Supreme Court nominees knowing that Trump could change his mind at the last minute. Trump has narrowed his list down to two potential nominees: Brett Kavanaugh and Thomas Hardiman. The White House expects to hit the ground running once Trump makes his 9 p.m. announcement – a time he selected for maximum TV exposure. "I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice," Trump tweeted. As he boarded Air Force One after a weekend of golfing at his private club in Bedminster, N.J., Trump said: "You can't go wrong."

3/ **Trump lashed out at NATO on Twitter two days before the alliance's summit**, saying NATO members "must do much more" and up their defense spending contributions.

4/ **The U.S. opposed a United Nations resolution encouraging breast-feeding, siding with manufacturers of infant formula** and stunning public health officials and foreign diplomats in the process this past spring. American officials wanted to soften the resolution by removing language that called on governments to "protect, promote and support breast-feeding." When the effort failed, the United States threatened to withdraw military aid and hit Ecuador and other countries with punitive trade measures if they didn't drop supported for the resolution. The U.S., however, backed off when Russia introduced the resolution. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/health/world-health-breastfeeding-ecuador-trump.html))

5/ **Rudy Giuliani appeared to confirm that Trump asked then-FBI director James Comey to drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn**. Trump has previously denied [asking](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/16/Day-117/#1-trump-asked-james-comey-to-shut-do) Comey "I hope you can let this go." "He didn't direct \[Comey\] to do that," Giuliani said. "What he said was, can you, can you ..." Giuliani continued: "He said a lot of other things, some of which has turned out to be untrue. The reality is, as a prosecutor, I was told that many times, 'can you give the man a break,' either by his lawyers, by his relatives, by his friends. You take that into consideration. But you know that doesn't determine not going forward with it." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/08/politics/giuliani-comey-flynn/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/trumps-personal-attorney-rudy-giuliani-special-counsel-investigation-56438915))

6/ **Giuliani: Michael Cohen "should cooperate" with prosecutors as long as he tells the truth**. Giuliani repeatedly downplayed the possibility that Cohen could provide damaging information to prosecutors. "As long as he tells the truth, we're home free." Two people familiar with Cohen's thinking say he has already "hit the reset button" and will continue to speak the "real truth." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/08/627107199/giuliani-says-michael-cohen-should-cooperate-with-prosecutors) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/cohen-trump-real-truth/index.html))

7/ **Giuliani: Trump is close to refusing to sit down for an interview with Robert Mueller**. On Friday, Giuliani set new conditions for an interview with the special counsel, saying Mueller needs to prove – before Trump would agree to sit for an interview – that Trump committed a crime and that his testimony is essential to completing the investigation. Giuliani also claimed that the Mueller investigation was the "most corrupt I've ever seen." He called prosecutors working on the investigation "very, very severe partisans working on an investigation that should have been done by people who are politically neutral."
