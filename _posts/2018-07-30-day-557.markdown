1/ **Rudy Giuliani: "Collusion is not a crime."** Trump's lawyer told Fox and Friends "I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians," and that he's been "looking in the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime." Giuliani asserted that "the hacking is the crime. The president didn't hack. He didn't pay them for hacking," suggesting that Trump would have had to pay for Russia to interfere on his behalf. Trump has argued for more than a year that there was "no collusion" – not that collusion wasn't a crime. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that "There is No Collusion!" and that "the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!"

* **Trump didn't tell the truth about the Russia investigation 7 times in 1 tweet**. Despite the tweet's brevity, there are at least seven examples of exaggerations, mischaracterizations and outright falsehoods contained in it. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/30/politics/donald-trump-tweets-mueller-russia/index.html))

2/ **Trump claimed that Robert Mueller's investigation has multiple "conflicts of interest," including a "very nasty and contentious business relationship"** between the two men. Giuliani said the dispute remains unresolved "even to this day," but refused to detail the alleged conflict. Last year, White House advisers said Mueller had a dispute over membership fees at Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia in 2011. Trump [tried to fire Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html) in June 2017 over alleged conflicts of interest. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/399427-trump-says-he-and-mueller-had-nasty-business-relationship) / [CNN ](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/29/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-twitter/index.html)/ [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/giuliani-wont-explain-the-very-nasty-business-relationship-trump-says-he-had-with-mueller/2018/07/30/c8088ede-93f8-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html))

* **Trump and his legal team have cut ties to Michael Cohen** for "violat\[ing\] the attorney-client privilege, publicly and privately." Giuliani confirmed the two sides have ended their joint defense agreement to share information. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/28/giuliani-cohen-trump-legal-teams-separated-747466) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joint-defense-cohen-experts-hired-analyze-trump-cohen/story?id=56890003))

* **Robert Mueller's office said Paul Manafort earned $60 million from his work as a political consultant in Ukraine**. The indictment against Manafort says $75 million flowed through offshore accounts controlled by Manafort and his former business partner Rick Gates. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/30/politics/mueller-says-manafort-earned-60m-from-ukraine-consulting/index.html))

3/ **Trump accused journalists of being "driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome"** and suggested that they are endangering American lives by revealing "internal deliberations of our government." He charged that journalists were "very unpatriotic!" for their negative media coverage of his administration. In a tweetstorm, Trump singled out the New York Times and the Washington Post after A. G. Sulzberger – publisher of the Times – released a statement about an off-the-record meeting between the two. Sulzberger disclosed the details of the meeting after Trump "put the meeting on the record" when he tweeted about his "very good and interesting meeting" with Sulzberger. Trump claimed the two discussed "the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media and how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!" ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-called-media-enemy-of-the-people-in-meeting-with-ny-times-publisher/2018/07/29/fec5adee-9330-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.3f04c3094771) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/399421-trump-calls-media-very-unpatriotic-for-reporting-on-government) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-sulzberger.html))

* **Trump has repeatedly tried to punish journalists for how they ask him questions**, directing White House staff to ban reporters from covering official events or to revoke their press credentials. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/venting-about-press-trump-has-repeatedly-sought-to-ban-reporters-over-questions/2018/07/27/0e73a068-91a9-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html))

4/ **Trump threatened to shut down the federal government if Democrats don't agree to sweeping changes to U.S. immigration laws and appropriate money to build his proposed border wall.** "I would be willing to 'shut down' government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall!" Trump tweeted on Sunday. "Must get rid of Lottery, Catch and Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!" Trump faced immediate words of caution from top Republican lawmakers, including the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

## Notables.

1. **The government has been secretly monitoring U.S. citizens when they fly since at least 2010** as part of a secret TSA program called "Quiet Skies." The program targets travelers who "are not under investigation by any agency and are not in the Terrorist Screening Data Base," but all U.S. citizens who enter the country are automatically screened for potential inclusion in the program. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/29/17627734/quiet-skies-tsa-flight-surveillance) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/air-marshals-have-conducted-secret-in-flight-monitoring-of-us-passengers-for-years/2018/07/29/b50ffe94-9370-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.f4bde010963e))

2. **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide detailed information by Wednesday about the location of "missing parents" the government deemed "ineligible" for reunification**. As of Friday, 650 of the 2,551 migrant children separated from their families at the border remain separated because their parents have been deemed ineligible. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-orders-trump-administration-help-lawyers-find-missing-parents-migrant-n895596))

3. **A group of 36 people representing all five of the Muslim-majority countries affected by the current travel ban are suing the Trump administration** in the first lawsuit since the ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in June. The suit names Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and other government agencies as the defendants. While the suit doesn't challenge the constitutionality of the ban, it instead asks the administration to explain how it grants waivers under the ban. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/29/17625194/travel-muslim-ban-lawsuit-waiver-how))

4. **Brett Kavanaugh sided with Trump Entertainment Resorts in a 2012 case that stopped a unionization drive at one of its casinos.** Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court voted to ignore an order from the National Labor Relations Board that would have required the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City to bargain with the United Auto Workers. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/kavanaugh-sided-with-trump-casino-in-2012-to-thwart-union-drive))

7. **Trump's golf resort in Scotland "partially destroyed" protected sand dunes**. Scottish Natural Heritage acknowledged that serious damage has been done to the site, which is of special scientific interest. Locals say Trump failed to honor promises to protect the site and that the development did not justify destroying the delicate ecosystem.
