1/  **Trump canceled the planned nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and accused North Korea of "tremendous anger and open hostility.**" In a letter to Kim, Trump wrote: "Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting."

* **North Korea demolished its nuclear test site ahead of a planned summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un**. North Korea officially closed down the site with a series of explosions that caused landslides near the tunnel entrances to the facility. The closure of the site is not irreversible, and several follow-up measures would be required in order to ensure the facility meets Trump's demands for true denuclearization. Kim also did not invite international nuclear weapons inspectors to the demolition. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/b3d007a341db451abc74d45279f0d5c7))

2/ **Trump said migrant children entering the country at the southern border are "not innocent,"** and warned that letting them in exposes the nation to increased gang crime. "They look so innocent," Trump said at a roundtable meeting at the Morrelly Homeland Security Center. He added: "They're not innocent."

3/ **Trump insisted that he will not sign any immigration bill that emerges from Congress unless it includes "a real wall" on the southern border.** Trump was responding to an ongoing effort in the House to force a vote on certain bills aimed at protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Factions of the House GOP are at odds over certain provisions in the various bills under consideration, including whether or not to provide permanent legal status for "dreamers" and those covered under DACA.

4/ **Trump said NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem shouldn't be allowed to play and suggested that they "shouldn't be in the country."** Trump said he doesn't like the provision in the NFL's new policy that allows players to remain in the locker room while the anthem is played. "I don't think people should be staying in locker rooms," Trump said, "but still I think it's good. You have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there, maybe you shouldn't be in the country."

5/ **Jared Kushner spent nearly seven hours with Mueller's team in April for his second interview with the special counsel**. Both times, Kushner met with investigators as a witness, not a target, of the investigation. The second interview focused on the 2016 campaign, the transition, the firing of James Comey, and other topics. Kushner's financial dealings and family business were not discussed. "They asked him questions, he answered every single one," said Kushner's attorney. "It was thorough."

6/ **The FBI seized control of a key server in Russia's global botnet of 500,000 hacked routers**. One of the goals of the operation was to use the information from the seized server to build a comprehensive list of victims in order to short-circuit the Kremlin's ability to reinfect targets. The FBI went after a complicated malware program called "VPN Filter" that has been linked to the Russian hacking group responsible for the breach of the DNC and the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election.
