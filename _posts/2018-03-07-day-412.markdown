1/ **Stormy Daniels is suing Trump for failing to sign the non-disclosure agreement that prevented her from discussing their "intimate" relationship**. Both Daniels and Trump's attorney Michael Cohen signed the agreement, but Trump never did. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, filed a civil suit with the Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday night seeking to void the 2016 "hush agreement," as it's referred to in the suit.

2/ **George Nader, former Trump aide and adviser to the United Arab Emirates, is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.** Mueller is looking at how foreign money may have influenced Trump's political activities and whether Nader funneled money from the UAE to support Trump's political efforts. Nader testified last week to a grand jury. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/george-nader-special-counsel-mueller-cooperating-seychelles.html))

3/ **The Trump administration is suing California over the state's so-called sanctuary laws.** The Justice Department claims California's immigration policies are unconstitutional and make it impossible for federal immigration authorities to do their jobs, which include deporting criminals who are in the U.S. illegally. Justice Department officials have asked a judge to block California's sanctuary laws.

4/ **Trump tweet-blamed presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama for the U.S. trade deficits and the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last 30 years**. "From Bush 1 to present," Trump tweeted, "our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars." A Ball State University [study](http://conexus.cberdata.org/files/MfgReality.pdf) suggests that automation – not moving jobs to China or Mexico – has been the major driver of job loss and that the decade between 2000 to 2010 marked the largest decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. From 1994 (the year NAFTA went into effect) to 2000, U.S. manufacturing jobs increased, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001).

5/ **Trump is telling staff he wants to sign a presidential proclamation tomorrow to set his steel and aluminum tariffs in motion**.
