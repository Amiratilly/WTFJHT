1/ **Rod Rosenstein is prepared to be fired by Trump**, telling confidants he has done his job with integrity and repeating the phrase "Here I stand." In recent private conversations, Rosenstein said history will prove he did the right thing by firing James Comey in May 2017, adding that Americans don't have all the facts about what led to his decision to write the memo that led to Comey's dismissal. If Rosenstein is fired, the next in line to oversee Mueller's probe is Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Trump, however, could choose to replace Rosenstein with anyone who has been confirmed by the Senate.

2/ **James Comey called Trump an "unethical" man "untethered to truth and institutional values"** in his [new book](https://amzn.to/2HwPV91), "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership." Comey describes Trump and his advisers as being unconcerned with whether Russia meddled in the election, but rather "debat{ing} how to position these findings for maximum political advantage." Trump, as president-elect, disputed the Steele dossier allegations that Trump watched sex workers urinate on each other. Comey writes that Trump insisted that "there's no way I would let people pee on each other around me" because he is a self-professed germophobe. "No way."

3/ **Trump tweets that Comey is a "weak and untruthful slime ball" who deserved to be fired "for the terrible job he did."** He added that Comey is a "proven LEAKER and LIAR" and that "it was my great honor to fire James Comey!" The pair of tweets are Trump's first remarks since advance copies of "[A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership](https://amzn.to/2GWXdG2)" surfaced. ABC's "20/20" will air an interview with Comey on Sunday morning, while Fox News will air a special called "The Trial of James Comey" on Sunday night.

4/ **The Republican National Committee launched a "Lyin' Comey" [website](https://lyincomey.com/) aimed at discrediting the former FBI chief**. The GOP plans to fact check James Comey's book and use "rapid response" to highlight any "misstatements" or "contradictions" in it.

5/ **Trump's allies are worried that the FBI may have seized recordings of conversations between Michael Cohen and his associates**. "We heard he had some proclivity to make tapes," said one Trump adviser. "Now we are wondering, who did he tape?" Cohen is known to record some of his conversations and store them as digital files. On Monday, FBI agents seized Cohen‚Äôs computers and phones.

7/ **Michael Cohen requested a temporary restraining order to limit what seized material the FBI can use** following the search of his office, home, and hotel room earlier this week. Cohen and a lawyer for Trump argued that the president has "an acute interest in this matter" because some of the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege.

* **FBI agents who raided Cohen's office sought information about taxi owners who had financial dealings with Trump's personal attorney**. The warrant specifically identified two Ukrainian immigrants who own a large taxi operation in Chicago. Cohen repeatedly loaned money to Semyon and Yasya Shatayner within the past 10 years.
