## ðŸ‘€ What I'm Watching.

*Robert Mueller's office is expected to reveal details about Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort today. I'll update today's post as necessary.* ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/manafort-special-counsel-lies.html)) 

1. **Cohen**: Federal prosecutors will submit a sentencing memorandum outlining how much time Cohen should spend in prison for admitting to lying to Congress. Cohen will be sentenced next week and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller's team and prosecutors in Manhattan investigating the Trump's inner circle in exchange for leniency. 

2. **Manafort**: Mueller's team pulled their plea deal with Manafort, accusing him of repeatedly lying to them. They left open the possibility of filing new charges against Trump's former campaign chairman. Mueller's team is expected to disclose details about Manafort's lies.

1/ **Trump kicked off the day by attacking the Mueller investigation in a series of angry, error-laden tweets** alleging that Mueller is biased, full of "Conflicts of Interest," and best friends with "Leakin' Lyin' James Comey." The eight-tweet tirade, which did not include any supporting evidence, came hours before Mueller is set to deliver important court filings in his cases against Cohen and Manafort.

* **Rex Tillerson: Trump is "undisciplined," "doesn't read briefing reports," and repeatedly tries to do illegal things**. "So often, the president would say, 'Here's what I want to do, and here's how I want to do it,'" Tillerson said, "and I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law.'" Tillerson once called Trump a "moron." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/rex-tillerson-trump-undisciplined-doesnt-like-read-tries-do-illegal-things/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/tillerson-says-he-often-had-tell-trump-his-directive-violates-n945176))

2/ **Trump claimed that his lawyers are preparing a "major Counter Report" to rebut Mueller's findings** in the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign. According to Trump, his lawyers have already completed 87 pages, adding, "obviously cannot complete until we the see the final Witch Hunt report." Trump's statement contradicts Rudy Giuliani, who said he hasn't had time to consider drafting a response plan, let alone work on a "counter report." Giuliani added that he spent the summer answering Mueller's questions, describing the process as "a nightmare" that took "about three weeks to do what would normally take two days."

3/ **CNN received a bomb threat and had to be evacuated as Trump attacked the media on Twitter as "the enemy of the people."** Trump's all-caps "FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" tweet was sent at 10:07 pm. A short time later, Don Lemon abruptly went to commercial break as CNN's New York studio was evacuated because of a bomb threat. The New York Police Department said the threat was not substantiated. Trump appears to be responding to a [report](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/trump-white-house-has-no-plan-counter-mueller-report/577417/) that the White House does not have a plan for how to respond to the Mueller report.

4/ **John Kelly is expected to resign as chief of staff in the coming days.** Kelly and Trump have reached an impasse and neither sees the situation as tenable as the two have also stopped speaking entirely in recent days. Nick Ayers, who currently serves as Pence's chief of staff, is seen as a leading candidate to replace Kelly. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/john-kelly-chief-of-staff-donald-trump/index.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kelly-idUSKBN1O61DV) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-07/john-kelly-s-white-house-exit-seen-as-certain-ayers-may-get-job) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-announces-changes-to-his-cabinet-white-house-chief-of-staff-may-be-gone-soon/2018/12/07/fc64830a-fa1d-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html))

* **Mueller's team interviewed Kelly in recent months about potential obstruction of justice**. The questions centered on Trump's attempt to fire Mueller in June 2017. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/robert-mueller-john-kelly-obstruction-investigation/index.html))

poll/ **71% of Republicans believe Mueller's investigation is a "witch hunt,"** while 82% of Democrats and 55% of independents see the investigation as "fair." Overall, 54% of Americans believe the Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign is fair.

## Notables.

1. **George Papadopoulos was released from prison after serving 12 whole days for lying to investigators** about his contact with individuals tied to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Papadopoulos will have 12 months of supervised release, serve 200 hours of community service, and pay a $9,500 fine. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/george-papadopoulos-prison/index.html))

2. **James Comey met behind closed doors with the House Judiciary and Oversight committees**. Lawmakers are expected to question Comey on a range of topics, including his memos about interactions with Trump, the details of his firing, the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, and whether bias contributed to the decisions to focus on Trump and to conduct surveillance on Carter Page. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/former-fbi-director-comey-to-testify-in-house-gop-probe/2018/12/06/8c1049f6-f9b2-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html))

3. **Trump named William Barr as his next attorney general**. If confirmed by the Senate, Barr will take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has served as acting capacity since Jeff Sessions was forced out. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/07/donald-trump-nominates-william-barr-attorney-general) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/trump-barr-kelly.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-confirms-he-will-pick-william-barr-as-his-next-attorney-general/2018/12/07/6e8d28ba-fa2d-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html))

4. **The Justice Department hasn't filed required paperwork stating when Jeff Sessions left office**. Federal law requires the vacancy and any acting appointment to be reported "immediately" to the Government Accountability Office. This reporting is important because Matthew Whitaker, acting attorney general, can only serve for 210 days. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisgeidner/justice-department-sessions-whitaker-gao))

5. **Trump nominated former Fox News anchor Heather Nauert as the next ambassador to the United Nations**. Nauert currently serves as the State Department spokeswoman. Her post as UN ambassador will be downgraded from its current cabinet-level status. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-07/trump-says-heather-nauert-will-replace-haley-as-un-ambassador) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/politics/heather-nauert-united-nations.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/06/heather-nauert-un-ambassador-pick-trump))
