1/ **Trump asked Jeff Sessions to reverse his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation in March 2017.** Trump berated Sessions in public and in private over his decision to step away, but Sessions refused Trump's request. Robert Mueller is investigating the previously unreported confrontation as part of the ongoing obstruction of justice probe. Mueller's interest in Sessions suggests the investigation may be even more broad than Trump's interactions with and subsequent firing of James Comey.

2/ **Federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen are set to receive 1 million files from three of Cohen's cell phones that were seized last month in raids on his apartment, office, and hotel room.** A court filing submitted by special master Barbara Jones on Tuesday says investigators for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have already received nearly 300,000 pieces of potential evidence from the raids. So far, only 252 seized items have been flagged by Cohen's or Trump's attorneys as privileged materials. An additional 292,006 items were turned over to prosecutors on May 23.

3/ **Trump bragged about a classified battle between U.S. forces and Russian mercenaries in Syria while speaking to donors at a closed-door fundraiser**. Trump said he was amazed by the actions of American F-18 pilots, suggested that the strikes lasted "10 minutes," and claimed they killed up to 300 Russians. The details of the battle remain classified. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/29/trump-bragged-about-classified-syria-skirmish-at-fundraiser-611599))

4/ **The Trump administration will impose restrictions on Chinese visas as part of its attempt to counter alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property by Beijing**. Under the new policy, U.S. consular officers may limit how long the visas will be valid, instead of simply issuing them for the maximum possibly length. Chinese graduate students studying robotics, aviation, and other high-tech fields will be limited to one-year visas. Chinese citizens seeking visas will require clearance from multiple U.S. agencies in order to work as researchers or managers at certain companies. The restrictions are set to go into effect on June 11. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/82a98fecee074bfb83731760bfbce515))

5/ **Ivanka Trump abruptly left a conference call about an upcoming fitness event after reporters asked her about her company's trademarks in China.** A White House official had previously said Ivanka would take a few questions before leaving for a meeting, but reporters immediately started asking questions about the trademarks. By the time someone asked a question about her father's fitness regime, a White House official on the call said Ivanka had already left for another meeting.

6/ **A new U.S. intelligence assessment concludes that North Korea does not intend to give up its nuclear arsenal any time soon.** The CIA analysis is consistent with expert opinion on the  subject, but it conflicts with Trump's recent claims that Kim intends to give up his nuclear stockpile in the near future. The assessment does note, however, that Kim Jong Un might open up a burger joint inside North Korea as a display of good will.

7/ **Senior House Republican Trey Gowdy said the "FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got" from an informant inside Trump's 2016 campaign.** Gowdy attended last week's highly classified Justice Department briefing about the FBI informant who approached multiple members of Trump's foreign policy team, including Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. Contrary to Trump and Guiliani's "spygate" conspiracy claims, Gowdy said the effort to place an informant inside the campaign had "nothing to do with Donald Trump."

8/ **Trump accused Democrats of siding with MS-13 gang members over the American people during a rally in Nashville.** "They don’t want the wall, they want open borders," Trump said. "They’re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you." Trump also reiterated that immigrants who commit crimes are "animals" by turning it into a chant for the crowd. “What was the name?” Trump called to the crowd. “Animals!” they shouted back. Trump also called Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer "an absolute, total tool," and referred to the House Democratic leader as "the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi."
