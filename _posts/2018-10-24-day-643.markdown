1/ **The Secret Service intercepted packages containing "potential explosive devices" addressed to Obama and Hillary Clinton**, similar to the one found at the home of George Soros. All three devices are of similar pipe-bomb-style construction. The Secret Service also said "the packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such."
