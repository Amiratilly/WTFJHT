1/ **Trump discussed withdrawing the U.S. from NATO with senior administration officials several times in 2018**, saying he didn't see the point of the military alliance, which has been in place since 1949. National security officials believe that Russia is focused on undermining the alliance so Putin could have the freedom to behave as he wishes. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html))

2/ **Trump's legal team refused requests by Robert Mueller's team for an in-person follow-up session with Trump**. The request was made after Trump submitted written answers to a limited number of questions from Mueller's office focusing on the period before Trump was in office. The two sides are reportedly at an impasse, with no meaningful discussion in roughly five weeks. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/politics/trump-interview-mueller-request/index.html))

* **Rick Gates is still cooperating with federal prosecutors on "several ongoing investigations."** In a status report filed by Mueller, the special counsel and the Gates defense team are asking a federal judge to ‚Äì again ‚Äì delay Gates' sentencing. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/425420-mueller-files-status-report-highlighting-cooperation-by-key-witness) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/mueller-says-gates-continues-to-cooperate-in-several-probes))

3/ **Mueller and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are looking at a meeting involving Devin Nunes, Michael Flynn, and dozens of foreign officials at the Trump International Hotel** in Washington, D.C. two days before Trump's inauguration. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are looking into whether the Trump inaugural committee misspent funds and if donors tried to buy influence in the White House. Mueller is also looking at the meeting as part of his investigation into whether foreigners contributed money to the Trump inaugural fund and PAC through American intermediaries.

* **Trump's inaugural committee spent more than $1.5 million at the Trump International Hotel for the 2017 swearing-in ceremony.** The expenses included $10,000 on makeup, $30,000 in per diem payments for contract staffers, $130,000 on customized seat cushions, and $2.7 million on a Broadway-style rendition of Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York." In the 72 days leading up to the inauguration, the committee spent a total of about $100 million. Inaugural committees are required to document every donation with the Federal Election Commission and those donations are now facing legal scrutiny over who funded them.

* **üìå [Day 694](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/14/day-694/#1-federal-prosecutors-are-investigat): Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Trump's inaugural committee and a pro-Trump super PAC received illegal donations from individuals from Middle Eastern nations** who were hoping to buy influence over U.S. policy. The inquiry focuses on whether people from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two Trump funds. Foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees, and inaugural funds are illegal. The inaugural committee was headed by Thomas Barrack, and Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman at the time, believed that Barrack could help raise funds for the super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, which could collect unlimited amounts of money. Barrack said that Manafort viewed the super PAC as an arm of the campaign, despite laws meant to prevent coordination. The committee raised $23 million on Trump's behalf.

* **üìå [Day 693](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/13/day-693/#4-federal-prosecutors-in-manhattan-a): Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Trump's 2017 inaugural committee misspent the $107 million it raised** and whether some of the donors gave money in exchange for access to the incoming Trump administration, policy concessions, or to influence administration positions. The committee said in its tax documents that it spent $77 million on conferences, conventions and meetings, $4 million on ticketing, $9 million on travel, $4.5 million on salaries and wages, and other expenses. Nearly a quarter of the money was paid to a firm led by a friend of Melania Trump that was formed 45 days before the inauguration.

* **üìå [Day 389](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/02/12/day-389/): Trump's inaugural committee won't reveal what it's doing with tens of millions of dollars it pledged to charity last year**. The committee raised about $107 million, but only spent about half of it. The rest, it said, would go to charity. ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trumps-inaugural-committee-still-wont-say-what-its-doing-with-its-leftover-money))

The firm was created in December 2016 ‚Äì 45 days before the inauguration. Trump‚Äôs inauguration committee raised $107 million and paid to WIS Media Partners $25.8 million. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-inaugural-committee-spent-nearly-107-million-on-events-1518722022))

Wolkoff was terminated last week because the Trumps were unhappy with the news reports about the contract. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html))

## Notables.

 1. **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to remove a citizenship question from the 2020 census**. The case is likely headed to the Supreme Court. Critics accused the Trump administration of trying to turn the census into a tool to advance Republican political fortunes by to reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives in 2021, which could affect Congress, the Electoral College, and thousands of state and local political districts. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/15/671283852/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-remove-2020-census-citizenship-question) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/politics/census-citizenship-new-york/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2019/01/15/ec70d5a8-18da-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/census-citizenship-question.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-rules-trump-administration-cant-ask-about-citizenship-on-census-11547564816))

 2. **Rand Paul will travel to Canada for a hernia surgery**. While Shouldice Hernia Hospital is privately owned ‚Äî like most Canadian hospitals ‚Äî it receives a majority of its funding from the Ontario government. Paul once called the idea of a national public health care system "slavery." ([USA Today](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/14/rand-paul-neighbor-attack-senator-have-surgery-canada/2568200002/))

 3. **Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee today to begin his confirmation hearing.** Lawmakers are expected to question William Barr on his views about Robert Mueller's investigation. In his written testimony, Barr said he "will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation." If confirmed, Barr will replace acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who took over after Jeff Sessions resigned in November. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/15/683009390/trumps-pick-for-attorney-general-goes-before-senate-committee-tuesday))

 4. **Ivanka Trump will help select the next head of the World Bank.** She will not be a candidate herself, but she will assist Steve Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney in choosing a successor to Jim Yong Kim, who abruptly announced his resignation last week, three years before his term was set to expire. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/ivanka-trump-world-bank-president.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trump-to-help-select-nominee-for-world-bank-president-11547503159) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/14/white-house-ivanka-trump-not-head-of-world-bank-1099104))

 5. **House Republican leaders stripped Rep. Steve King of his seats on the Judiciary and Agricultural Committees** after he rhetorically questioned how "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization ‚Äî how did that language become offensive?" King was denounced by a number of prominent republicans, including Mitch McConnell, who suggested that King find "another line of work." King has refused to resign, instead criticizing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, saying, "Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/steve-king-white-supremacy.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/14/bobby-rush-censure-steve-king-racist-1099484) / [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-move-to-censure-rep-steve-king-over-racial-statements/2019/01/14/a56854e4-182e-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/steve-king-republicans-house-committees-white-nationalist) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/politics/mitch-mcconnell-steve-king-condemnation/index.html))

 6. **Mitch McConnell blocked a House-passed package to reopen the federal government for a second time**. One bill would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, while the other would fund the rest of the impacted departments and agencies through Sept. 30. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/425414-mcconnell-blocks-house-bill-to-reopen-government-for-second-time))

 7. **House Democrats turned down an invitation to have lunch with Trump at the White House**, saying the meeting would be little more than a photo op benefiting Trump. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/rank-and-file-democrats-reject-trumps-invitation-to-shutdown-talks-backing-leaders-in-united-opposition-to-border-wall/2019/01/15/2539482e-18d2-11e9-9ebf-c5fed1b7a081_story.html))

 8. **More than 40,000 immigration court hearings have been canceled due to the shutdown**. The Pentagon has directed additional funds to extend troop deployment at the U.S.-Mexico border.

([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/15/source-white-house-believes-shutdown-will-be-twice-as-costly.html))

11. **Trump served "great" "American fast food paid for by me" to Clemson University's football team**. The menu consisted of more than 300 burgers from "McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King's with some pizza," Trump told reporters. Trump spent less than $3,000 on feeding the team and, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, he paid "for the event to be catered with some of everyone's favorite fast foods" because "Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security \[and\] much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-welcomes-clemson-tigers-white-house-american-fast-food-paid-n958661) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/politics/donald-trump-clemson-food/index.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/donald-trump-orders-fast-food-white-house-clemson-football) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/15/president-trumps-extravagant-sandwich-celebration-clemson-university/))
