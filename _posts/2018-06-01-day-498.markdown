1/ **The European Union opened a case at the World Trade Organization in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.** The EU is also expected to announce retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. on products such as Levi's jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries, and peanut butter. "The European Union is not at war with anyone," said the EU high representative on foreign policy. "We don’t want to be; for us this out of the question … The European Union is a peace project, including on trade."

2/ **Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused to attend a meeting with Trump to discuss the renegotiation of NAFTA because Mike Pence told him the meeting would only happen is Trudeau agreed to include a five-year sunset clause into the deal.** Trudeau said it was a "totally unacceptable" precondition. "I had to highlight there was no possibility of any Canadian prime minister signing a NAFTA deal that included a five-year sunset clause and obviously the visit didn't happen," Trudeau said.

3/ **American employers added 223,000 jobs in May, bringing the national unemployment rate to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent.** Average hourly pay rose by 2.7 percent compared to last year, but pay rates remain below typical levels when the unemployment rate is this low. Some economists are concerned that Trump's aggressive actions on international trade could disrupt the recent economic progress, but most employers have not suspended hiring yet.

4/ **Trump broke with decades of protocol by publicly commenting on the jobs report data 69 minutes before they were released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.** Treasury yields shot up just seconds after Trump tweeted that he was "looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning." Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to George W. Bush, said Trump's tweet was "certainly a no-no. The advance info is sacrosanct – not to be shared."

5/ **Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. recently interviewed James Comey as part of a probe into whether former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe broke the law by lying to federal agents.** The decision to interview Comey suggests prosecutors are seriously considering whether to charge McCabe with a crime. The Inspector General accused McCabe of lying to investigators on four occasions about authorizing a disclosure to the media. McCabe was under oath for three of those instances.

6/ **Jared Kushner's close friend Andrew Gerson has come under scrutiny from Robert Mueller's team. Mueller is interested in Gerson's supposed knowledge of meetings in January 2017 between Trump associates and foreign officials in the Seychelles.**  Gerson was in the Seychelles around the same time that Erik Prince secretly met with Russian and UAE officials, including Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, also known as MBZ. Gerson met with MBZ and Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, who organized the meeting with Erik Prince.

7/ **Trump made 3,251 false or misleading statements during his first 497 days in office — an average of more than 6.5 false or misleading claims per day.** During his first 100 days, Trump made an average of 4.9 claims a day. His average for May 2018 was about eight per day, including a record 35 false or misleading claims in a single day at his rally in Nashville on May 29.

### Notables

1. **Trump called for Samantha Bee to lose her job over her comments about Ivanka Trump.** Trump claimed there was a "total double standard" when it comes to the reaction to Bee's comments versus the reaction to Roseanne Barr's racist tweet. "Why aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show?," Trump tweeted. "A total double standard but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!"
