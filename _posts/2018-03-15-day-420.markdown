1/ **Trump imposed sanctions on Russian organizations and individuals** in retaliation for interference in the 2016 presidential election and other "malicious" cyberattacks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the cyberattacks "the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history," having caused billions of dollars in damage in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sanctions-russian-spies-trolls-over-us-election-interference-cyber-attacks/2018/03/15/3eaae186-284c-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-15/u-s-sanctions-russian-troll-farm-for-alleged-election-meddling))

2/ **A lawyer for the Trump Organization filed documents to keep Stormy Daniels from talking about her alleged affair with Trump**. A "demand for arbitration" document dated February 22, 2018, names Jill Martin, a top lawyer at the Trump Organization, as the attorney representing the company Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, established to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Daniels. The new documents, marked "HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL PROCEEDING," show a direct connection between Trump's company and the nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed, raising questions about Cohen's previous statement that "neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford." Stormy Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford.

3/ **At a fundraiser Trump bragged that he made up facts about U.S. trade relations with Canada during a meeting with Justin Trudeau**, insisting that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with Canada without knowing whether that was true. Canada and the U.S. calculate the trade balance differently. According to Statistics Canada, Canada runs a surplus, while the U.S. Commerce Department reports a $12.5 billion U.S. surplus. Regardless, Trump doubled down on his claim of a deficit, tweeting: "We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive)."

> **Excerpt from Trump's fundraising speech**
>
> "Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, 'No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,'" Trump said during fundraising speech, according to audio obtained by the Washington Post. Trump continued: "I said, 'Wrong, Justin, you do.' I didnâ€™t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, 'You're wrong.' You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart."

4/ **Conor Lamb officially won the special House election in Pennsylvania**. Lamb won by a very small margin, securing his victory after just a few thousand absentee ballots came in. Rick Saccone may still contest the outcome of the election. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/democrats-republicans-pennsylvania-special-election.html))
