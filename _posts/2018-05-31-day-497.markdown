1/ **Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe wrote a confidential memo about a May 2017 conversation he had with Rod Rosenstein regarding the firing of James Comey.** The memo says Trump originally asked Rosenstein to reference Russia in the public memo used to justify firing Comey. McCabe thought that seemed like evidence that Comey's firing was actually about the Russia investigation and that Rosenstein was helping to provide a cover story by writing about the Clinton investigation.

2/ **The White House announced a new 10% tariff on metal imports from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, which supply nearly half of all U.S. metal imports.** The steel and aluminum tariffs will go into effect at midnight on Thursday. The European Union immediately announced that it would impose countermeasures against the U.S. as a response. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/trump-aluminum-steel-tariffs.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-the-european-union-canada-and-mexico/2018/05/31/891bb452-64d3-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?utm_term=.e672e06eabc6) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/trump-administration-will-put-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-the-eu.html))

3/ **Trump is preparing to block German luxury carmakers from the United States.** Trump told French president Emmanuel Macron last month that he planned to stop Mercedes-Benz from driving down Fifth Avenue in New York. No further details are currently available about the specific policies Trump might pursue in order to effectively prevent German automakers from selling in the U.S. ([NBC News](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/trump-reportedly-poised-to-ban-german-luxury-carmakers-in-the-us.html) / [WirtschaftsWoche](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/auto/importzoelle-trump-will-daimler-vom-us-markt-aussperren/22620470.html))

4/ **The FBI is reconstructing shredded documents seized last month in the raids on Michael Cohen's apartment, office, and hotel room.** A small amount of shredded materials were seized, and agents are currently working to piece together the contents of at least one paper shredder that was recovered during the raid.

5/ **Trump offered a full pardon to conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza for violating campaign finance laws.** D'Souza illegally used straw donors to funnel additional money into the campaign of a GOP Senate candidate in 2012, and pleaded guilty to the charges in 2014. He was sentenced to five years of probation and a $30,000 fine. “Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today,” Trump tweeted on Thursday. “He was treated very unfairly by our government!” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-offers-pardon-to-conservative-pundit-dinesh-dsouza-for-campaign-finance-violations/2018/05/31/b4939a08-64d5-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html?utm_term=.1e25d71764c7))

6/ **Trump is also considering commuting the sentence of former Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and pardoning Martha Stewart.** Trump brought up the commutation and additional pardon while talking to reporters on Air Force One, shortly after he announced D'Souza's pardon via Twitter. Blagojevich began a 14-year prison sentence for corruption in 2012 and was scheduled to get out in 2024. Stewart was convicted in 2004 of obstruction of justice and lying to the government about her insider trading. Blagojevich is a former contestant on "The Apprentice," and Trump said Stewart "used to be one of my biggest fans."

* **President Trump keeps pardoning his political friends.** Beyond breaking the seal on the pardon power much earlier in his presidency, publicly teasing them before carrying through, and so far using them for very political ends, Trump's pardons are also different because they have occurred one at a time.

6/ **Newly-released voter registration data from California show the Republican party trailing behind both Democrats and "no party preference" voters**. The California Republican Party has effectively been relegated to third-party status, falling behind independent voters by at least 73,000, leaving them with only 25.1 percent of registered California voters.

### Notables.

1. **Mike Pompeo's meeting with a high-ranking North Korean official ended two hours earlier than planned** because the talks "went well" and "made progress," according to a U.S. official. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/2ea1432ce0cc4de2a99eb1bfdb683d65))

2. **The White House has been sending its talking points about the Iran deal to foreign policy heavyweights on both sides of the aisle, including former Obama administration officials and advisers for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.** White House communications aide Kelly Sadler forgot to BCC recipients of an email blast about Trump's Iran strategy, revealing the uncharacteristically inclusive email list and confusing frequent critics of the administration.
