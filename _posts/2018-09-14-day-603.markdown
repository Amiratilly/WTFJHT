1/ **Paul Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy and agreed to fully cooperate with Robert Mueller.** While the details about what kind of information Manafort agreed to provide the special counsel remain unclear, a judge asked Manafort, "You understand that you are agreeing to cooperate fully and truly" in the agreement?

2/ **Jared Kushner defended the eviction of the Palestine Liberation Organization from its Washington offices by insisting that punishing Palestinians would not affect the chances of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.** "There were too many false realities that were created — that people worship — that I think needed to be changed," Kushner said during an interview. "All we’re doing is dealing with things as we see them and not being scared out of doing the right thing. I think, as a result, you have a much higher chance of actually achieving a real peace."

3/ **The secret letter about Brett Kavanaugh that Sen. Feinstein shared with federal investigators yesterday charges that a teenage Kavanaugh and a male friend trapped a teenage girl in a bedroom during a party and tried to assault her.** According to the letter, Kavanaugh had been drinking at a party when he and his friend took the girl into a bedroom. Kavanaugh allegedly got on top of the girl and put his hand over her mouth as the music was turned up. The woman was reportedly able to exit the room before anything else happened. Kavanaugh denied the allegation. "I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation," he said in a statement. "I did not do this back in high school or at any time."
