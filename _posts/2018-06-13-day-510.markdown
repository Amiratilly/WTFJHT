3/ **Rod Rosenstein plans to call on the House general counsel to investigate the conduct of House Intelligence Committee staff**, including Devin Nunes. Committee staffers [claimed](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/12/rosenstein-threatened-to-subpoena-gop-led-committee-in-chilling-clash-over-records-emails-show.html) Rosenstein threatened to "subpoena" emails, phone records and other documents during a tense meeting earlier this year, which one aide described as a "personal attack." The Justice Department disputes the account, saying Rosenstein "was making the point – after being threatened with contempt" by House Republicans that "he would have the right to defend himself, including requesting production of relevant emails and text messages and calling them as witnesses to demonstrate that their allegations are false." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/rod-rosenstein-house-investigation/index.html))

5/ **Robert Mueller revealed new evidence that Paul Manafort directed an unregistered lobbying campaign in the U.S.** on behalf of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

6/ **Mueller's office claimed that Russian intelligence agencies are trying to meddle in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections** as prosecutors try to block intelligence agencies and defendants from seeing evidence in the investigation of interference in the 2016 election.

The only defendant in that case is the Russian firm Concord Management and Consulting, which is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman known as Putin's chef. The pretrial process entitles a defendant the material assembled during the investigation. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/mueller-russia-midterms-influence-641851))
