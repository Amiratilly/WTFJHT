1/ **The Trump administration has lost track of nearly 6,000 unaccompanied migrant children** – thousands more than the Department of Health and Human Services had previously acknowledged. HHS placed more than 42,497 unaccompanied children with sponsors in fiscal year 2017. Officials tasked with reaching out to sponsors and children to check on their well-being said 14% of calls were not returned – meaning the Trump administration has lost track of 5,949 children.

2/ **Trump accused Democrats of wanting "illegal immigrants ... to pour into and infest our country."** Trump also rejected a proposal by Senator Ted Cruz to end family separations, calling the plan to hire thousands of new immigration judges "crazy," suggesting that the judges could be corrupt and the lawyers representing detained immigrants were "bad people."

3/ **More than 600 members of Jeff Sessions' church filed a formal complaint accusing him of "child abuse,"** "immorality," and "racial discrimination" for his "zero-tolerance" immigration policy that has led to children getting separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Yesterday, Jeb Bush [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/1008730704497258496): "Children shouldn't be used as a negotiating tool. @realDonaldTrump should end this heartless policy and Congress should get an immigration deal done that provides for asylum reform, border security and a path to citizenship for Dreamers."

5/ **The U.S. will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council**.
