1/ **Senate Republicans plan to move forward with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation despite sexual assault allegations by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford**. Trump, in defending Kavanaugh, said it was "very hard for me to imagine anything happened" with Ford because Kavanaugh "is such an outstanding man." Sen. Chuck Grassley said a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing would begin at 10 a.m. Monday, and gave Ford a deadline of 10 a.m. Friday to submit prepared remarks if she plans to testify. While Ford has not officially declined the committee's invitation, her attorney has asked for a "full, nonpartisan investigation." ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-plan-to-push-ahead-on-kavanaugh-confirmation-1537370636) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-alleged-assault-by-kavanaugh-is-very-hard-for-me-to-imagine/2018/09/19/07a71002-bbf3-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/kavanaugh-accusations-trump-blasey-ford.html))

2/ **Sen. Dean Heller called the sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh a "little hiccup"** and that he hopes "all senators" will address the accusations "in good faith" so they can "get through this" and "off to the races." The Nevada Republican went on to call Trump "a great leader" despite saying he was "99 percent against Trump" in October 2016. Heller is considered the most vulnerable Senate Republican seeking reelection this year.

3/ **Trump continued to insist that there is no role for the FBI in investigating Dr. Ford's claims**. Trump said the FBI investigating Ford's accusation that Brett Kavanaugh covered her mouth while trying to strip her bathing suit off during a high school party in the 1980s "is not really their thing." Former government officials, however, have come forward to contradict Trump's claim that the FBI cannot investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh. While Republican leaders in the Senate have echoed Trump's claim, several officials involved in nomination and background check processes say it's actually common.

4/ **A former classmate of Ford walked back her claims that she knew about Brett Kavanaugh's alleged assault at the time it happened**. "That it happened or not, I have no idea," said Cristina Miranda King. "I can't say that it did or didn't." In a now-deleted Facebook post, King previously said: "The incident DID happen, many of us heard about it in school." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649787076/kavanaugh-accuser-classmate-that-it-happened-or-not-i-have-no-idea))

5/ **Senator Clair McCaskill will vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, but not because of the allegations against him.** McCaskill cited Kavanaugh's "positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy," as the reason for her "no" vote. McCaskill says Kavanaugh "revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations" and that she is "uncomfortable about his view on Presidential power," as well as his "position that corporations are people." The Missouri Democrat is running for re-election this year in a state Trump won in 2016. Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate and could still confirm Kavanaugh's appointment even if all Democrats were to oppose his nomination.
