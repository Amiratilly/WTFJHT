1/ **The House of Representatives passed a stopgap measure funding measure that includes $5.7 billion in border wall funding** after Trump threatened to veto the Senate-passed stopgap spending bill. The bill passed on a near-party-line vote of 217 to 185. Democrats, however, have the Senate votes to block any bill that includes funding for Trump's wall, while Trump says he'll veto any bill that doesn't. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-stopgap-funding-bill-5-billion-trump-s-border-n950666) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-continues-retreat-on-government-shutdown-threat-pledges-to-renew-border-control-battle-in-2019/2018/12/20/3143a752-0457-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html))

* **The Senate began a procedural vote on whether to take up the House of Representatives funding bill**. The Senate needs a simple majority to allow the proposed law to move forward to a final vote. After nearly 90 minutes, the tally is currently stuck at 44 in favor of the measure and 46 opposed. It's currently unclear if the Senate would be able to proceed to a final vote.

2/ **Trump threatened a "shutdown today" that will last "a very long time" if his wall isn't funded**. Trump tried to blame it on a "Democrat Shutdown" despite last week taking responsibility about how we would be "proud to shut down the government." Trump also urged McConnell to change Senate rules so Republican could "use the Nuclear Option and get it done!" Trump warned that "If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/trump-government-shutdown-border-wall-funding) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-warns-government-shutdown-could-last-very-long-time-if-n950746) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/422420-trump-shutdown-today-if-senate-fails-to-pass-funding-bill-with-border) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-budget-idUSKCN1OK15M) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-leans-on-mcconnell-to-pass-spending-bill-with-border-funding-in-senate/2018/12/21/31bb453a-0517-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.cf931864e6ab) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-shutdown-border-wall.html))

* **McConnell and Senate Republicans rejected Trump's demand to eliminate the filibuster**, signaling that the Senate does not have enough votes to change the rules to pass Trump's border wall funding with a simple majority. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but Democrats can block the House bill with a filibuster and other procedural moves, which require 60 votes to overcome.

* **Trump compared his border wall to the invention of "the wheel," saying "there is nothing better" because – he claims – he understands "technology on a Border" "better than anyone."** He then compared his wall to Israel's wall with Gaza to defend against Democrats "trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned." ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-border-wall-tweet-us-mexico-proposed-latest-a8694431.html))

* **Federal agencies are preparing to furlough 380,000 workers**. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-prepare-for-a-possible-shutdown-11545415407))

* **Government shutdown 101**: What is it, will it happen and who's to blame? ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/us-government-shutdown-explainer-what-is-it-will-it-happen-and-whos-to-blame) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/20/18150263/house-republicans-trump-border-wall-government-shutdown))

3/ **The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to automatically reject asylum bids by immigrants who illegally cross the U.S-Mexico border**. Federal immigration law says people may apply for asylum "whether or not at a designated port of arrival" and "irrespective of such alien's status." The Trump policy would require all asylum claims to be made at official ports of entry. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/supreme-court-rejects-trump-bid-to-curb-asylum-claims-at-border-jpygbmcr) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-denies-trump-administration-request-to-immediately-enforce-new-asylum-rules/2018/12/21/e9cdaf32-03c8-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/trump-asylum-ban-us-mexico-border-supreme-court-reject))

poll/ **58% of Americans believe Trump tried to obstruct the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia**. 38% believe Trump did something illegal, 34% believe he did something unethical, but not illegal, and 25% Americans believe Trump did nothing wrong.

## Notables.

1. **Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery to remove two cancerous nodules from her left lung**. After the surgery, her thoracic surgeon said the nodules were malignant and that "there was no evidence of any remaining disease" and "scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-cancer.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/21/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-surgery/index.html))

2. **Republican megadonor Robert Mercer has retreated from financially backing Trump's agenda**. The Mercers gave just over $25 million to conservative causes in 2016. This year the family gave $6.4 million to Republicans – the lowest amount since 2012. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/robert-mercer-scales-back-gop-support-after-scrutiny-for-backing-trump.html))

3. **Russians tried to compromise the voting systems used during the midterm elections**, but were reportedly unsuccessful, according to Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/russia-midterm-election-influence-coates.html))

4. **Trump is already souring on Mick Mulvaney over a two-year-old video where Mulvaney calls Trump "a terrible human being."** Mulvaney hasn't started as acting White House chief of staff yet. Trump was reportedly "furious" when he heard about the footage. In a separate interview from 2015, Mulvaney called Trump's view on a border will "simplistic," absurd and almost childish." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/pre-christmas-trump-rebuked-rampaging-mattis-reisgnation-014a96ab-a4ec-4504-9ebb-ed96167382bc.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/21/politics/mulvaney-on-trump-in-2015/index.html))

5. **Trump complained to aides that it's unfair he is being blamed for the market's downturn and concerns of an economic slowdown**. Trump has repeatedly pointed to market gains as proof that his economic policies are working and that the country is thriving under his leadership. Unless an end-of-year rally emerges, 2018 will be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008 and the S&P 500 on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.

6. **One Republican close to the White House described Trump as in "a tailspin," acting "totally irrationally," and "flipping out"** over criticisms from conservatives calling him a "gutless president," and questioning whether he would ever build a wall. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-tailspin-under-siege-trump-propels-the-government-and-markets-into-crisis/2018/12/20/e30347e0-046b-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html))
