1/ **Trump's outside advisers told him he doesn't need a chief of staff or a communications director**. While John Kelly has tried to bring order to the policymaking process, Trump has grown frustrated by the long-established West Wing management structure, because it doesn't fit his freewheeling style. Following Hope Hicks' departure, Trump has been open to rethinking the traditional communications director role. He'd like Kellyanne Conway to assume the role.

2/ **EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt lived in a condo tied to an energy industry lobbyist**. The townhouse near the U.S. Capitol is co-owned by J. Steven Hart, who wouldn't say how much Pruitt paid to live there. Hart's firm has lobbied on "issues related to the export of liquefied natural gas." During a December 2017 trip to Morocco, Pruitt pitched "the potential benefit of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports on Morocco's economy."

3/ **Michael Cohen's attorney denied that Trump knew about the $130,000 hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels**, saying "the president was not aware of the agreement." David Schwartz added: "At least Michael Cohen never told him about the agreement. I can tell you that." Experts suggest the denial could insulate Trump, but could also undermine the nondisclosure agreement that Daniels signed, which prevented her from disclosing her alleged affair with Trump. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/29/we-finally-got-an-answer-as-to-whether-trump-knew-about-the-stormy-daniels-payment/))

* **A federal judge in California temporarily stopped efforts by Stormy Daniels' attorney to depose Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen**. The court denied Michael Avenatti's motion for an expedited trial and discovery process because Trump and the company established by Cohen to pay Daniels the $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair between her and Trump, have not yet filed a petition to compel arbitration, which they have stated they're going to do.

4/ **David Shulkin said he was fired as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, because he was standing in the way of the Trump administration privatizing the VA**, with "some political appointees choosing to promote their agendas instead of what's best for veterans." The former secretary said the "people who want to put VA health care in the hands of the private sector ... saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/opinion/shulkin-veterans-affairs-privatization.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597866101/fired-va-secretary-says-white-house-muzzled-him))

5/ **Trump's nominee to run the VA has never managed a large bureaucracy**. White House physician Ronny Jackson is the doctor who gave Trump a positive physical and mental health assessment in a televised briefing in January. Trump liked the way Jackson handled himself with reporters during the briefing, which played a part in Jackson's nomination for secretary of Veterans Affairs.

6/ **The Department of Housing and Urban Development is attempting to reverse federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws**. Under Ben Carson, HUD has been freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses while sidelining officials who have attempted to pursue civil rights cases. The goal is to roll back the Obama administration's efforts to reverse racial, ethnic, and income segregation in housing and development projects subsidized by the federal government. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/ben-carson-hud-fair-housing-discrimination.html))

7/ **The Justice Department will investigate the surveillance of Carter Page**, a former Trump campaign official. The inspector general has faced increasing political pressure from Republicans in Congress and Jeff Sessions  to examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and policies while seeking approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/justice-department-carter-page-surveillance.html))

poll/ **54% of Americans expect Trump to lose his campaign for re-election**. 79% of Republicans expect Trump to win his 2020 re-election bid, while 87% of Democrats expect him to lose. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/29/politics/poll-2020-trump-democrats/index.html))
