1/ **The White House received the FBI's report on Brett Kavanaugh and said it's "fully confident" he will be confirmed by the Senate**. The White House said it found no evidence in the FBI report corroborating Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. Mitch McConnell scheduled a procedural vote for Friday. If the motion passes, Senators will have 30 hours to debate Kavanaugh's confirmation before making the final decision.

* **More than 1,700 law professors signed onto a letter opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.** The letter to the Senate says "the unprecedented and unfathomable demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh" during his hearing last week displayed a lack of judicial restraint and should disqualify him from serving on the nation's highest court. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/03/kavanaugh-confirmation-temperament-law-professors-868125) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/10/04/unprecedented-unfathomable-more-than-law-professors-sign-letter-after-kavanaugh-hearing/?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_term=.fa019a15e16b))

* **A group of 100,000 Christian churches called for Kavanaugh's nomination to be withdrawn**, saying he "exhibited extreme partisan bias and disrespect towards certain members of the committee and thereby demonstrated that he possesses neither the temperament nor the character essential for a member of the highest court in our nation." The National Council of Churches represents 45 million churchgoers in the U.S. ([Fortune](http://fortune.com/2018/10/03/national-council-of-churches-demands-kavanaugh-withdraw/))

* **A former Kavanaugh classmate at Yale said the Supreme Court nominee lied under oath about his drinking and the meaning of his yearbook entries.** "Brett Kavanaugh stood up under oath and lied about his drinking and about the meaning of words in his yearbook," writes James Roche. "He did so baldly, without hesitation or reservation." Roche said there is "zero chance" that Deborah Ramirez made up her accusation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party. He also said Kavanaugh lied about never blacking out from drinking, and about the definition of the word "boofing."

2/ **Sens. Susan Collins and Jeff Flake called the FBI report "reassuring" and "thorough,"** adding that they see "no additional corroborating information" to back up Ford's allegations. Democrats called the report "incomplete," saying the FBI – at the White House's direction – limited the investigation to protect Kavanaugh. The two Republican senators said they are still undecided about how to vote, but a "yes" vote from both would secure Kavanaugh's seat on the Supreme Court. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/grassley-says-new-fbi-report-kavanaugh-includes-no-new-info-n916601) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senators-prepare-to-review-fbi-report-on-kavanaugh-after-early-morning-arrival/2018/10/04/394dbaf8-c7be-11e8-b2b5-79270f9cce17_story.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-judiciary-receives-fbi-report-kavanaugh-allegations/story?id=58277222))

* **48 Senators publicly support Kavanaugh's nomination – all Republicans**. There are three undecided Republicans – Collins, Flake, and Lisa Murkowski – and one undecided Democrat – Joe Manchin. Kavanaugh needs to pick up at least two of those four votes to advance. Heidi Heitkamp said she will vote "no" on Kavanaugh's nomination. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/04/kavanaugh-confirmation-fbi-report-869433) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kavanaugh-heitkamp/democratic-senator-heitkamp-a-no-on-kavanaugh-nomination-idUSKCN1ME2ED))

3/ **There is a single copy of the FBI's findings available to Senators to review** in a vault in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. The report cannot leave the room, Senators can't bring their phones into the SCIF, and if they take notes, the notes must be left in the room when they leave. All 100 senators, four majority committee staffers, four minority committee staffers, and one committee clerk are cleared to view the report. Sen. Dick Durbin called the process "bizarre," although it's a standard process for FBI background reports. This FBI report will likely never be made public.
