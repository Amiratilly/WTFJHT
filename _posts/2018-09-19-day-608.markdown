1/ **The Trump administration is unable to account for nearly 1,500 additional migrant children who were placed with sponsors after leaving federal shelters.** The revelation comes months after a similar admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government lost track of 1,475 migrants children who were moved out of shelters last year. Since 2016, HHS officials have called sponsors to check on children 30 days after they are placed, but the department has said it can not be held legally responsible for children after they are released from government custody.

2/ **Dr. Christine Blasey Ford wants the FBI to investigate her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh before senators hold a hearing on the allegations.** Dr. Blasey's attorneys sent a letter to the FBI arguing that "a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions." Blasey has not confirmed whether she will attend a public hearing on Monday about her allegations against Kavanaugh.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/kavanaugh-what-happens-geogetown-prep-828420))

* **George W. Bush reaffirmed his support for Kavanaugh:** "Laura and I have known and respected Brett Kavanaugh for decades, and we stand by our comments the night Judge Kavanaugh was nominated." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/george-bush-supports-kavanaugh-827976))

* **One of Dr. Blasey's former classmates wrote a Facebook post saying she remembers hearing about the alleged assault by Kavanaugh.** Cristina Miranda King says she has no first-hand information to corroborate Blasey's claims. "I did not know her personally but I remember her," King wrote. "This incident did happen." King has since taken down her post "because it served its purpose and I am now dealing with a slew of requests for interviews." She added: "Was not ready for that, not sure I am interested in pursuing. Thanks for reading."

4/ **The FBI and DOJ are expected to defy Trump's order to declassify and release unredacted versions of Carter Page's FISA warrant and text messages sent by agency officials**, including former FBI director James Comey. The agencies are expected to submit their documents and propose redactions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which will package the materials and send them to the White House for approval and release. Doing so would put the agencies in direct conflict with Trump, who has the power to override them and declassify the materials on his own. Some of what Trump requested was already under review for potential declassification.
