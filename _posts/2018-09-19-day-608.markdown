1/ **The Trump administration is unable to account for nearly 1,500 additional migrant children who were placed with sponsors after leaving federal shelters.** The revelation comes months after a similar admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government lost track of 1,475 migrants children who were moved out of shelters last year. Since 2016, HHS officials have called sponsors to check on children 30 days after they are placed, but the department has said it can not be held legally responsible for children after they are released from government custody.

2/ **Christine Blasey Ford wants the FBI to investigate her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh before senators hold a hearing on the allegations.** Ford's attorneys sent a letter to the FBI arguing that "a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions." Ford has not confirmed whether she will attend a public hearing on Monday about her allegations against Kavanaugh.

3/ **Sen. Chuck Grassley canceled a meeting where members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were expected to vote to advance Kavanaugh's confirmation.** The meeting was originally scheduled for Thursday morning, and a new date has not been announced.

4/ **The FBI and DOJ are expected to defy Trump's order to declassify and release unredacted versions of Carter Page's FISA warrant and text messages sent by agency officials**, including former FBI director James Comey. The agencies are expected to submit their documents and propose redactions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which will package the materials and send them to the White House for approval and release. Doing so would put the agencies in direct conflict with Trump, who has the power to override them and declassify the materials on his own. Some of what Trump requested was already under review for potential declassification.

5/ **A new federal court ruling requires political nonprofits to disclose many of their political donors.** The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to intervene and grant an emergency request to stay a ruling by a federal judge in Washington. The federal judge threw out a decades-old FEC regulation allowing nonprofits to keep their donors hidden unless the donations were earmarked for specific purposes.

4. **Stormy Daniels said in her new book that Trump's penis looks like Toad from Mario Kart.** "I lay there," Daniels writes, "annoyed that I was getting fucked by a guy with Yeti pubes and a dick like the mushroom character in Mario Kart... It may have been the least impressive sex I’d ever had, but clearly, he didn’t share that opinion.” ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-penis-looks-like-toad-from-mario-kart-says-stormy-daniels) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/18/stormy-daniels-tell-all-book-on-trump-salacious-detail-and-claims-of-cheating))
