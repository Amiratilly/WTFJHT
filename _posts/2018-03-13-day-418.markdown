1/ **Trump fired Rex Tillerson. CIA Director Mike Pompeo will replace Tillerson as Secretary of State.** Trump asked Tillerson to step aside last Friday.

Trump said the move had been considered for "a long time" and that "we were not thinking the same."

2/ **Hours before being fired, Rex Tillerson called the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter an "egregious act" that "clearly" came from Russia**. He added that Russia is "an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens." On Monday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said it is "highly likely" Russia is responsible for the poisoning, either directly or because it lost control of the nerve agent. The two were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in the U.K. and were found unconscious.

3/ **Gina Haspel, currently the deputy director of the CIA, will replace Pompeo as the head of the CIA, if confirmed**. Haspel oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting their interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand.

4/ **House Intelligence Committee Republicans said their investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians**. The committee agreed with the findings of the intelligence community that Russia had interfered, but they disagreed that the Russians favored Trump. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said the Republican decision to end the investigation was "another tragic milestone for this Congress, and represents yet another capitulation to the executive branch," adding: "By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly."

5/ **In the spring of 2016, Roger Stone said he learned from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that the organization had obtained emails the emails of John Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee**. WikiLeaks released the documents in late July and October. U.S. intelligence concluded the hackers who obtained the emails were working for Russia. Stone has since denied any communication with Assange or knowledge of the document dumps by WikiLeaks. Assange and WikiLeaks have also said they never communicated with Stone.

6/ **A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman resigned over what he says were "false" and "misleading" statements by Justice Department officials**, including Jeff Sessions and ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan. James Schwab said he couldn't continue to do his job after Trump administration officials made false public statements about a key aspect of a recent Northern California sweep.
