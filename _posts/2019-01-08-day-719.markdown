  about the shutdown and the border; Manafort''s lawyers accidentally revealed that
  he shared 2016 polling data with people who have ties to Russian intelligence; and
  Natalia Veselnitskaya was even more closely tied to the top Russian prosecutor than
  we thought. '

1/ **Several major TV networks will broadcast Trump's national address tonight at 9 p.m. ET**, during which Trump will discuss the ongoing partial government shutdown and his views on the situation at the southern U.S. border. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and Fox Business have all confirmed that they will air Trump's remarks, despite the 1,130 false statements Trump has already made about immigration since he took office.  A response from Congressional Democrats will follow Trump's remarks.

* **Trump's aides have been laying the rhetorical foundation for Trump to declare a national emergency at the U.S. southern border**, which would allow him to circumvent Congressional approval for his long-promised border wall.

2/ **Paul Manafort gave 2016 polling data to one of his former employees with ties to Russian intelligence services.** Manafort shared the data with a former employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, an exchange which was inadvertently revealed after Manafort's lawyer failed to fully redact parts of Manafort's interview with Robert Mueller in a court filing. The filing also revealed that Mueller accused Manafort of lying about a text he received from "a third-party asking permission to use Mr. Manafort's name as an introduction in the event the third-party met the President." Manafort's attorneys meant for Mueller's accusations to remain private, but the text in the court filing was easily readable when the relevant sections were viewed using a word processor.

3/ **Natalia Veselnitskaya worked secretly with the Russia prosecutor general to draft the Russian response as part of a U.S. money-laundering case.** Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with top Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower in 2016. The case in question isn't directly related to the Trump Tower meeting, but instead involved a scheme to launder dirty money through New York real estate purchases. The indictment says Veselnitskaya covertly worked with the high-level Russian prosecutor to draft an "intentionally misleading" response to the civil case, which constitutes obstruction of justice in the eyes of the Southern District of New York. Veselnitskaya is believed to be in Russia and is not expected to return to the U.S. to face the charges.

## Notables.

1. **U.S. carbon emissions increased by 3.4% in 2018, the largest jump in eight years.** More coal plants are shutting down while the demand for electricity is rising and the Trump administration continues to rolling back environmental regulations meant to speed the growth of renewable energy. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/08/carbon-emissions-trump-agenda-climate-change) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase.html))

2. **The Trump administration quietly downgraded the diplomatic status of the European Union's delegation last year without formally announcing the decision or informing the E.U. about the change.** The classification was at least temporarily reversed after Brussels protested and scheduled a meeting with the Trump administration to discuss the move. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/world/europe/eu-us-diplomatic-status.html))

3. **The Justice Department is attempting to delay the testimony of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker until next month**, after a permanent replacement has been chosen.
