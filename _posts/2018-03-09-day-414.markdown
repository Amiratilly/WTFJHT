1/ **Michael Cohen used his Trump Organization email to arrange the $130,000 transfer to Stormy Daniels** in exchange for her silence about her affair with Trump. Trump's personal attorney regularly used the same email account during 2016 negotiations with the actress – whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford – before she signed a nondisclosure agreement. Daniels filed a civil suit against Trump alleging the contract she signed is invalid because it's intentionally missing Trump's signature "so he could later, if need be, publicly disavow any knowledge of the 'Hush Agreement'" or the affair.

2/ **Trump will meet with Kim Jong-un to negotiate "permanent denuclearization" of North Korea**, which will cease all missile testing while the negotiations are being held. The two leaders are expected to meet in the next 60 days. News of a potential meeting has been met with positive reactions from China, Russia, and South Korea.

* **Dennis Rodman is one of two people who have met both Trump and Kim Jong-un**. The other is South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-yong, who extended the invitation from Kim to Trump during a visit to Washington this week.

3/ **Sen. Dean Heller believes Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire this summer**, which would set up Trump to fill a second Supreme Court seat. Last year he nominated Neil Gorsuch to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. Heller is one of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2018, and he's hoping a Supreme Court vacancy "will get our base a little motivated because right now they're not very motivated. But I think a new Supreme Court justice will get them motivated."

4/ **Sam Nunberg appeared at a federal courthouse in Washington to deliver federal grand jury testimony** as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Nunberg made no comment to reporters as he entered the courthouse, other than to say that he would not make a statement after his grand jury testimony. Last week Nunberg gave a series of interviews in which he offered speculation about some people involved in the Russian investigation and said he would not comply with Mueller's subpoena.

5/ **The Interior Department spent almost $139,000 on new doors for Ryan Zinke's office.** Zinke was apparently unaware of the expenditure until a reporter from the Associated Press reached out to him to confirm the cost. According to a department spokesperson, the doors to Zinke's office required a security upgrade because they would not lock.
