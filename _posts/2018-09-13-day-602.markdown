1/ **Sen. Dianne Feinstein referred a letter to FBI containing information about an incident involving possible sexual misconduct between Brett Kavanaugh and a woman when the two were in high school.** The letter is said to be from one of Feinstein's California constituents. Feinstein did not show the letter to any of her Democratic colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/brett-kavanaugh-accused-sexual-misconduct-1120385) / [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/09/12/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-dianne-feinstein/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/13/647511365/democrats-refer-kavanaugh-allegations-to-fbi-deepening-divide-over-his-nominatio) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lissandravilla/senate-democrats-have-sent-a-secret-letter-about-brett))

* **Sen. Corey Booker released another batch of confidential documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.** The 28 new documents are from Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush White House and show his involvement in judicial nominations, including the more controversial judges from that time. Kavanaugh told a Senate committee in 2006 that he wasn't involved in the controversial nomination of circuit court nominee Charles Pickering, but the documents released Wednesday show the opposite. Kavanaugh held meetings with Republican senators and was closely involved in Pickering's nomination.

* **The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote until next week.** ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-committee-delays-vote-on-kavanaugh-nomination-until-next-week/2018/09/13/726bdb7e-b758-11e8-b79f-f6e31e555258_story.html?utm_term=.91358e615005))

2/ **The DHS inspector general is investigating whether FEMA administrator Brock Long misused government vehicles during his commutes from Washington to North Carolina.** The inspector general is looking into whether Long misused government resources and personnel during his six-hour trips back to his home in Hickory, NC on the weekends. The IG became interested in the case after one of Brock's government vehicles was involved in an accident.

3/ **The Trump administration quietly redirected $200 million from various DHS programs to ICE accounts despite repeated congressional warnings about ICE's "lack of fiscal discipline" and "unsustainable" spending habits.** The news comes a day after a financial document was released showing that $10 million was diverted from FEMA to ICE in June to help pay for ICE detention operations. Of the $200 million, $93 million will go toward immigrant detention and $107 million will go toward paying for deportations.

4/ **Meanwhile, the number of unaccompanied minors detained at the border has risen to the highest number ever recorded.** Population levels at federal shelters for migrant children have increased more than five-fold since last summer. This month, there were more than 12,800 children in custody, compared to 2,400 in May 2017. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/migrant-children-detention.html))

5/ **Trump accused Democrats of inflating the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria.** "3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico," Trump tweeted. "When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths." Trump claimed that Democrats added anyone who died for any reason to the list of hurricane-related deaths. "This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list." He added: "I love Puerto Rico!"

## Notables.

1. **Trump has made 5,000 false or misleading claims during his time in office.** His 5,000th claim came yesterday in the form of a tweet about Robert Mueller: "Russian ‘collusion’ was just an excuse by the Democrats for having lost the Election!"
