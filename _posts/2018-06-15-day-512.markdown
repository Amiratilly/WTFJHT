1/ **A federal judge revoked Paul Manafort's bail and sent him to jail while he awaits trial** after Robert Mueller accused Trump's former campaign chief of witness tampering. "I cannot turn a blind eye to this," Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. Manafort had posted a $10 million bond to remain at home while awaiting his September trial on charges that include money laundering and false statements. He will now remain in pretrial detention until his trial.

2/ **Michael Cohen filed for a restraining order against Michael Avenatti to stop him from speaking to the media about the Stormy Daniels case.** Cohen argued that Avenatti's "publicity tour" of more that 100 television interviews since March is unethical, and harms Cohen's ability to have a fair trial by turning the case into a "media circus." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/15/cohen-lawyer-gag-order-avenatti-648958) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/cohen-restraining-order-avenatti/index.html) / [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michael-cohen-restraining-order-stormy-daniels-lawyer-avenatti-press-trump-a8400086.html))

* **Michael Cohen has told family and friends that he is willing to cooperate with federal investigators**. The treatment from Trump and Rudy Giuliani has left Cohen feeling isolated, angry, and more open to cooperating. Cohen has not met with prosecutors to discuss any potential deal and is currently looking for a new legal team. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/michael-cohen-cooperation-federal-investigators/index.html))

* **Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Cohen violated federal disclosure laws as part of his consulting deals**, including whether he lobbied for domestic or foreign clients without properly registering.

3/ **Giuliani called on Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein to "redeem themselves" by suspending the Robert Mueller investigation today**. Giuliani also called for Peter Strzok to be put in jail over a series of text messages he exchanged with fellow FBI agent Lisa Page during the 2016 election campaign. "Mueller should be suspended and honest people should be brought in, impartial people to investigate these people like Strzok," Giuliani said. "Strzok should be in jail by the end of next week." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/14/giuliani-mueller-russia-probe-suspended-647022))

4/ **Trump "certainly wouldn't sign" the Republican immigration proposal** that would protect young undocumented migrants and end the  policy of separating families at the southern border. Paul Ryan plans to bring up two immigration measures for a vote next week: a hard-line conservative bill, which will likely fail, and "a very good compromise" bill. Trump said he "wouldn't sign the more moderate one." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-congress-trump/trump-says-he-will-not-sign-moderate-dreamer-immigration-bill-idUSKBN1JB1SD) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/trump-immigration-compromise.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/15/trump-reject-republican-immigration-policy-protecting-families) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-i-certainly-wouldnt-sign-house-gop-immigration-compromise/2018/06/15/731ffedc-70a0-11e8-9ab5-d31a80fd1a05_story.html))

5/ **The Trump administration announced a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports** as Trump vowed to respond to what he called China's unfair trade practices. China retaliated with $50 billion worth of tariffs with "equal scale, equal intensity" on U.S. imports, calling Trump "fickle" and "provoking a trade war." The Dow fell 250 points in response to rising trade tensions.

* **German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted of an escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and the European Union**. Merkel warned that Europe's strategic interests are tied to the future of the car industry shortly after Trump cited national security concerns as a reason to place tariffs on German cars. "We should think about the strategic significance of the auto industry for the European Union," Merkel said, "so we can prepare an exchange with the U.S." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-germany-merkel/competition-authorities-might-need-to-look-at-big-u-s-platforms-merkel-idUSKBN1JB12Y))

6/ **Trump held an interview with "Fox and Friends" on the White House lawn** after musing on Twitter that "maybe I'll have to make an unannounced trip down to see them" and live-tweeting segments from the show. Trump called James Comey a criminal, said the FBI is a "den of thieves," blamed Democrats for the separation of families at the US border, said it's "great to give" Kim Jong-un credibility, and again blamed Obama for Russia's annexation of Crimea.
