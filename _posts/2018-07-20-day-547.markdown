1/ **Michael Cohen recorded a conversation with Trump two months before the presidential election discussing payments to Karen McDougal**, the former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump. Prosecutors want to know if Cohen's efforts to limit negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated federal campaign finance laws. The FBI seized the recording during the [raid on Cohen's office](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/04/09/day-445/#1-the-fbi-raided-michael-cohens-offi). Rudy Giuliani confirmed that Trump had discussed the payments with Cohen on the tape, but said the payment was ultimately never made.

* ⏪ **WTF Rewind: Four days before the 2016 election**. The company that owns the National Enquirer paid McDougal $150,000 for her story about an with Trump affair a decade ago, but then didn't publish the story – effectively silencing McDougal for the remainder of the campaign. At the time, Hope Hicks said, "We have no knowledge of any of this" agreement, adding that McDougal's claim of an affair with Trump was "totally untrue."

2/ **The FBI reopened the Hillary Clinton email investigation 11 days before election because they were focused on investigating the Trump campaign's connections to Russia**, according to the FBI's Inspector General [report](https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download). In late September 2016, FBI agents learned about a new batch of Clinton emails from the laptop of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, who was under investigation for sexting a minor and was married at the time to Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The bureau was evidently overwhelmed with the urgency of the Trump-Russia investigation that management lapses and communication breakdowns caused a monthlong delay in looking into the new Clinton email. Nine days after announcing he was reopening the probe, James Comey said the FBI found nothing in the new email to change the original July decision against bringing charges.

3/ **The Justice Department will alert American companies, private organizations, and individuals when they are being targeted by foreign actors** attempting to affect elections or the political process. "Exposing schemes to the public is an important way to neutralize them," Rod Rosenstein said. "The American people have a right to know if foreign governments are targeting them with propaganda."

4/ **The Trump administration has reunited 364 of the 2,500\+ children who were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.** The administration has a week left before the court-imposed deadline to reunite the families. Of the 1,607 parents eligible for reunification, 719 have received final orders of deportation, meaning they could be deported as soon as they are reunited with their children.
