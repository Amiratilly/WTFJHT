1/ **The Senate voted 51-49 to advance Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination**. Republican Lisa Murkowski voted not to advance the nomination. She called the cloture vote "a mistake" and that Kavanaugh is "not the best man for the court at this time." Democrat Joe Manchin voted in favor. Flake told reporters he would support Kavanaugh on the final vote, "unless something big changes."

2/ **Susan Collins will support Kavanaugh's nomination, effectively ensuring enough votes for his confirmation**. During a lengthy speech, Collins said the confirmation process has "been in steady decline for more than 30 years," with Kavanaugh's nomination hitting "rock bottom." She said it's her "fervent hope" that Kavanaugh will "work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court." Collins added that "the MeToo movement is real," that "it matters," is "needed and it is long overdue," but that Christine Blasey Ford's "allegations fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard" and "I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court."

3/ **Joe Manchin will also vote "yes" on Kavanaugh's nomination**, announcing his decision immediately after Collins. Manchin is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state. Machin said he had "reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing," but "found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him."

He acknowledged that he "might have been too emotional" during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.
