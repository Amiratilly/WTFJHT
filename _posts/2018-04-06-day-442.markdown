1/ **Robert Mueller has evidence that questions Erik Prince's Congressional testimony about a chance meeting last year in Seychelles with Kirill Dmitriev**, the manager of a state-run Russian investment fund close to Putin. George Nader, a cooperating witness with limited immunity, told investigators that he facilitated and personally attended a meeting between Prince and Dmitriev days before Trump was inaugurated. The goal of the meeting was to discuss foreign policy and to establish a line of communication between the Russian government and the incoming Trump administration. Prince told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in November that "I didn't fly there to meet any Russian guy," and the meeting with Dmitriev as unexpected. Prince founded the private military contractor Blackwater USA and is the brother of Betsy DeVos, who serves as Trump's Secretary of Education. As of late March, Mueller's team has not asked Prince to appear before the grand jury.

2/ **Mueller's investigators questioned a Trump Organization associated about Michael Cohen's involvement in business deals in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Russia**. The special counsel showed up unannounced at the home of the business associate this week with a subpoena seeking information about the efforts by Trump's personal attorney and a former Trump Organization employee to expand the Trump brand abroad.

* **Last year, Mueller seized three bank accounts a day before Paul Manafort was indicted**. The previously unknown move was revealed in a list warrants prosecutors submitted to a federal court in Washington after Manafort's defense team complained that the government was withholding information about how the warrants were obtained. The special counsel also obtained a search warrant for information on five phone numbers last month.

3/ **The Trump administration imposed new sanctions on 17 Russian government officials, a state-owned weapons company, and seven oligarchs** and 12 companies affiliated with them. "The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. "Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government's destabilizing activities." The sanctions were in response to the "totality of the Russian government's ongoing and increasingly malign activities in the world," including interfering in the 2016 election and aggressions in Crimea, Ukraine, and Syria.

4/ **Trump proposed an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese products** beyond the $50 billion in tariffs the White House announced earlier this week. China responded by announcing $50 billion in tariffs on American goods. Trump said the move was a direct response to "unfair retaliation" by China.

5/ **John Kelly urged Trump to remove Scott Pruitt last week** following a series of negative reports about his spending habits and management style. Trump, however, is not ready to fire the EPA chief, tweeting today that Pruitt is doing "a great job," and that he is "TOTALLY under siege." White House aides believe that Pruitt's position is untenable. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-chief-of-staff-urges-trump-to-remove-epa-chief-pruitt-1523033081))
