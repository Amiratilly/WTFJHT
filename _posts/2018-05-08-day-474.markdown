1/ **Trump will announce the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal**, reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the accord, and impose additional economic penalties. Trump's aides persuaded him twice last year not to withdraw. Trump will formally announce his decision at 2 p.m. today at the White House.

2/ **Trump is frustrated with Rudy Giuliani's inability to handle the Stormy Daniels situation** and is concerned that Giuliani's media appearances are raising more questions than they are answering. Some aides say they expect Trump to fire Giuliani if he is unable to turn things around. Trump recently told a confidant that perhaps Giuliani should "be benched" from TV appearances temporarily if he can't stay on-message. Giuliani, however, said that Trump "is encouraging me to do more of them. I try to keep them under control," adding that Trump is "very comfortable" with the strategy.

3/ **Robert Mueller rejected Trump's request to answer questions from investigators in writing**. Trump's legal team had been pushing for Mueller to allow him to submit written answers, because they're afraid that Trump might lie to or mislead investigators during an in-person interview. Giuliani said he would fight a potential subpoena for Trump to testify in front of a grand jury, but has stopped short of saying that Trump would ignore a subpoena from the special counsel.

4/ **Trump's lawyers hope to decide whether he will testify by May 17th** â€“ the one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump's lawyers contend that testifying would be a distraction to his work as president. However, in an informal, four-hour practice session, Trump was only able to walk through two questions. "Anyone can see he has great difficulty staying on a subject," one person familiar with the legal team's deliberations said.

5/ **Senior White House staff are urging Trump to fire EPA chief Scott Pruitt**, who is currently the subject of 11 federal investigations. Some Republicans are also calling for his resignation. Trump has championed Pruitt up to this point, but support from the president appears to be waning as Pruitt's mounting legal and ethical issues continue to pile up.
