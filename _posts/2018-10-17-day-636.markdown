1/ **Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings after the midterm elections on whether Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia and if Trump obstructed justice during the probe**. Rod Rosenstein has indicated that he wants Mueller's probe to conclude as soon as possible. The findings may not be made public since Mueller can only present the findings to Rosenstein, who can then decide what is shared with Congress and what is publicly released. Trump, meanwhile, has signaled that he may replace Jeff Sessions and there are rumors that Rosenstein could resign or also be fired by Trump after the election.

* **ðŸ“Œ The Re-up: [Day 613.](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/09/24/day-613/#5-rod-rosenstein-did-not-resign-but) Rod Rosenstein did not resign, but "offered to resign" in discussions with John Kelly**. Rosenstein and Trump will meet on Thursday to discuss the deputy attorney general's future at the Justice Department. Rosenstein went to the White House this morning for a meeting where he "expect\[ed\] to be fired." The news follows reports that Rosenstein discussed the idea of [wearing a wire](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/#4-rod-rosenstein-raised-the-idea-of) last year to secretly record Trump in order to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the President from office. Rosenstein has been overseeing Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired with those efforts. Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, would take on oversight of Mueller's investigation and could fire or limit the investigation.

## Notables.

1. **Trump won't accept blame if Republicans lose control of the House in the midterms**.
