1/ **Trump backtracked and tried to spin his Helsinki summit comments, saying he misspoke and meant to say "I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia" that interfered in the election** while he read from prepared remarks. Trump also said "I accept" the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but added that it "could be other people also" and claimed that "Russia's actions had no impact at all" on the outcome. Yesterday, Trump said he doesn't "see any reason" why Russia would meddle during the last election, blaming the U.S. for acting with "foolishness and stupidity" toward Russia in the past, and rejecting the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Instead, Trump said he believed Putin's denial.

4/ **The U.S. Treasury will no longer require nonprofits like the NRA, Koch network's Americans for Prosperity, and Planned Parenthood to identify their financial donors to the IRS**. Super PACS and other 501(c)(4) organizations will no longer have to provide the IRS with the names of donors who give them $5,000 or more. Critics said the measure will increases the likelihood of illegal donations of "dark money" from both domestic and foreign contributors.
