1/ **Trump, in a tweet, suggested that students and neighbors should have reported the Florida shooter to authorities**, saying there were "so many signs" that the shooter "was mentally disturbed." A student who witnessed the shooting called out lawmakers on TV, looking directly into the camera and saying: "We're children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together, come over your politics, and get something done." He added: "Ideas are great but without action, ideas stay ideas and children die."

2/ **The admission that Michael Cohen facilitated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels is raising legal and ethical questions**. In particular, Cohen declined to say whether Trump or another party later reimbursed him for the payment. He insisted that the payment was a legal, personal gift by him to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. A lawyer who represented Clifford in the 2016 transaction issued a statement that said Cohen told him that the $130,000 payment was coming from his personal funds.
