2/ **A student who witnessed the shooting called out lawmakers on TV, looking directly into the camera and saying: "We're children. You guys are the adults**.

3/ **The admission that Michael Cohen facilitated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels is raising legal and ethical questions**. In particular, Cohen declined to say whether Trump or another party later reimbursed him for the payment.

A lawyer who represented Clifford in the 2016 transaction issued a statement that said Cohen told him that the $130,000 payment was coming from his personal funds.

5/ **Trump will veto a bipartisan immigration deal** that would create a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants and allot $25 billion for border security, according to the White House. While negotiators in both parties reached a tentative agreement yesterday, the measure appears to be several votes short of the required 60-vote threshold in the Senate.
