1/ **Putin lobbied Trump on nuclear arms control, banning weapons in space, and several other issues during their private two-hour meeting in Helsinki last month**, according to a leaked Russian document. Putin shared the document of proposed topics for negotiation with Trump during their two-hour conversation, which Trump's top advisers were not privy to at the time. Among the priorities, Putin wanted to extend an Obama-era nuclear-reduction treaty to ensure the "non-placement of weapons in space," which would hamper Trump's ability of establishing a Space Force.

* **Rand Paul delivered a letter from Trump to Putin during his trip to Moscow earlier this week**. Paul said he was "honored" to share the letter, which "emphasized the importance of further engagement in various areas including countering terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming cultural exchange." Rand also said members of the Russian Federation agreed to visit Washington at his invitation despite the White House recently announcing that Trump would delay any meeting with Putin until the Russia investigation concludes.

2/ **Trump's legal team responded to Robert Mueller's request for interview with the president, signaling openness to some obstruction of justice questions**. Rudy Giuliani would not describe the details of the counteroffer other than to call "it is a good faith attempt to reach an agreement." According to Giuliani, it's ultimately "his decision" â€“ Trump's â€“ as to whether or not to grant Mueller an interview. Giuliani added that "this should be over by September 1," because "we do not want to run into the November elections."

* **Why Trump really wants his Mueller interview**. The president, who's pushing his lawyers to let him meet with the special counsel, has a long history of dealing with investigators directly. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/08/trump-mueller-new-york-766212))

3/ **China announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods**, including large passenger cars and motorcycles, various fuels, and fiber optic cables. China is targeting 333 goods in total, including coal, grease, Vaseline, asphalt and plastic products, and recyclables. The latest round of Chinese tariffs are a direct response to the $16 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be hit with tariffs by the U.S. starting on Aug. 23.

## Notables.

1. **GOP Rep. Chris Collins was charged with insider trading by the Justice Department**. Collins turned himself in to the FBI on Wednesday and was charged in a case related to Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian biotech company where Collins served on the board. Prosecutors say Collins provided his son with nonpublic information about drug trial results in order to help him "make timely trades in Innate stock and tip others." A grand jury indictment also charges Collins' son, Cameron, as well as Cameron's father-in-law-to-be.
