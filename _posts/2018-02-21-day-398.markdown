1/ **Trump challenged Jeff Sessions to investigate the Obama administration for not doing enough to stop Russian interference in the 2016 election**. "If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation?" Trump tweeted. "Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!" Trump has singled out his own attorney general several times for not doing enough to protect him from the Russia probe. In July, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889790429398528000) that Sessions "has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes." A few hours later, Trump [called](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889467610332528641) Sessions "beleaguered."

2/ **Jared Kushner is pushing back against attempts to revoke his access to highly classified information**, setting up an internal struggle with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Last week, Kelly issued a five-page memo outlining that the White House will no longer allow some employees with interim security clearances to access to top secret information if their background investigation has been pending since before last June. Kushner's security clearance has been pending for more than 13 months. The White House, meanwhile, insists that Kushner can continue in his role as a senior adviser even without a security clearance.

3/ **Alex van der Zwaan pleads guilty in Robert Mueller's probe**. The son-in-law of a Russia-based billionaire admitted to lying to investigators about his communications with Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign aide. Van der Zwaan also admitted that he deleted records of emails that prosecutors had requested. It's the fourth guilty plea Mueller has secured, but van der Zwaan is the first not to enter into a cooperation agreement with the special counsel's office.

4/ **Mueller's decision to charge van der Zwaan puts additional pressure on Paul Manafort and Rick Gates**, both of whom worked with van der Zwaan on a report supporting the legitimacy of the criminal prosecution of a former Ukrainian prime minister. Prosecutors have also accused Manafort and Gates of laundering millions of dollars and concealing their lobbying efforts in Ukraine.

5/ **The White House has given David Skulkin permission to purge "subversion" at the Department of Veterans Affairs**. The cabinet head said that those who have defied his authority "won’t be working in my operation" and "those who crossed the line in the past are going to have to be accountable for those decisions." The move comes after a recent inspector general report found that Shulkin pressured the VA's third-most-senior official to alter an email to make it appear that he was receiving an award from the Danish government in order to have the VA pay for his wife's airfare. The IG investigation also found that Shulkin had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets from a friend. Shulkin's foes have been using the report in their push to oust the Veterans Affairs secretary.

6/ **Democrats flipped a Kentucky state legislature seat in a district that Trump won by 49 points in 2016**. Linda Belcher won the special election in Kentucky's House District 49 by a 68-32 margin. Trump carried the district by a 72-23 margin in 2016, which also went 66-33 for Mitt Romney in 2012. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/20/17034262/kentucky-special-election-linda-belcher))
