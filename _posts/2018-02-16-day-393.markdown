1/ **Robert Mueller's federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals** and three Russian entities with the intent to interfere "with U.S. elections and political processes." Mueller's office said that the government accuses all the defendants of conspiracy to defraud the United States. Three defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. The indictment charges that a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency, waged "information warfare" against the U.S. by using fictitious American personas and social media platforms for "supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump ... and disparaging Hillary Clinton."

2/ **Rick Gates is close to a plea deal with Robert Mueller.** The former Trump campaign adviser has been involved in plea negotiations for about a month and people familiar with the case say he is poised to cooperate with the investigation. If Gates agrees to a plea deal, he will be the third known cooperator in the special counsel's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

3/ **The FCC is investigating whether its chairman "improperly coordinated with Sinclair" on rule changes that benefited the broadcaster**. Ajit Pai is under investigation by the agency's independent watchdog for his role in the FCC adopting new rules that allowed television broadcasters to increase the number of stations they own weeks before Sinclair announced a $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media. The deal would not have been possible without the new rules. The investigation into Pai's relationship with Sinclair began at the end of last year.

4/ **The FBI acknowledged that it failed to act on a tip in January that Nikolas Cruz had the potential of "conducting a school shooting."** The tipster said Cruz had a "desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts." The FBI said some "protocols were not followed."

### Notables.

1. **Paul Ryan doesn't think the time is right to wage political battles over the issue of guns in America.** "This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings," Ryan said, adding: "We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/paul-ryan-gun-laws/index.html))

2. **The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 16-5 in favor of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act**, despite protests from Jeff Sessions that the bill would increase violent crime and hamstring federal law enforcement. The bill would reduce some federal sentencing rules along with reforms for the federal prison system. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/sentencing-prison-reform-senate-grassley-sessions/index.html))

3. **Trump set the record for the longest time period of time without a formal press conference in the last 50 years.** The last time a president went more than a year between press conferences was during the Lyndon B.

Bush had held five.([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/president-trumps-new-record-the-longest-time-without-a-formal-press-conference-in-half-a-century))
