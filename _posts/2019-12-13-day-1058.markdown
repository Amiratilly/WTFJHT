1/ **The House Judiciary Committee voted over Republican objections to advance two articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress**. In back-to-back votes, the Democratic-controlled committee adopted each charge against Trump by a margin of 23 to 17. The Judiciary Committee spent two days debating the articles, including a marathon 14-hour hearing yesterday, which Chairman Jerrold Nadler abruptly recessed before midnight without a vote. Deliberations today lasted less than 10 minutes. A full House vote is expected next week, and if either charge is approved, Trump would become the third American president to be impeached. Trump remained defiant on Twitter, insisting he had done "NOTHING wrong" and called Democrats "the Party of lies and deception!"

2/ **Mitch McConnell: There's "no chance" that Trump will be removed from office as a result of the impeachment trial in the Senate**. McConnell added that it "wouldn't surprise" him if some Democrats broke ranks to vote in favor of Trump, calling the case "so darn weak." McConnell and the White House have agreed to coordinate their plans for the trial, which McConnell has said he will end as soon as he has 51 GOP votes in place for a final vote. "We know how it's going to end."

3/ **Rudy Giuliani was seen entering the White House** just as the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve articles of impeachment against Trump. Giuliani has said he planned to create a "report" on the findings of his recent trip to Ukraine and wanted to brief officials. It was not clear if Giuliani was meeting with Trump.

* **üìå[Day 1049](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/12/04/day-1049/#4-rudy-giuliani-traveled-to-europe-t): Rudy Giuliani traveled to Europe to meet with several former Ukrainian prosecutors in an effort to defend Trump against the impeachment inquiry**. Giuliani traveled to Budapest to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, before going to Ukraine to meet with a number of other former prosecutors, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk. It was Giuliani's earlier interactions with some of the same Ukrainians that setup the impeachment inquiry in the first place and led to an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether Giuliani violated federal lobbying laws.

* **üìå [Day 1054](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/12/09/day-1054/#trump-said-giuliani-wants-to-testify): Trump said Giuliani wants to testify before impeachment investigators about his recent trip to Ukraine**. Trump added that Giuliani will "make a report" of his findings to submit to Barr and Congress. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/07/trump-giuliani-ukraine-trip-077725) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-giuliani-will-report-to-justice-department-congress-on-his-investigations-in-ukraine/2019/12/07/c8cbabae-192f-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html))

4/ **More than $20 million of the military aid that was supposed to go to Ukraine still hasn't reached the country**. $20.2 million of the Pentagon‚Äôs $250-million portion of the aid is still sitting in U.S. accounts, undermining one of the key GOP arguments against impeachment: that Ukraine eventually received the aid despite the hold placed on it by the Trump administration. Letters from lawmakers to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other officials asking about the continued delay have gone unanswered. ([Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-12-12/millions-in-military-aid-at-center-of-impeachment-hasnt-reached-ukraine))

5/ **The Trump administration released a trove of heavily redacted documents that contain the first communications between government agencies when the military aid to Ukraine was withheld earlier this year**. The documents include email conversations between the deputy comptroller at the Department of Defense and White House Office of Management and Budget staff, as well as spreadsheets of financial figures that appear to be related to Ukraine. The documents are so heavily redacted that most of the details about the conversations and exchanges remain unclear.
