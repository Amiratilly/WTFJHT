todayInOneSentence: The partial government shutdown continued into its 17th day as
  the ability of the IRS to issue tax refunds and the USDA to issue SNAP benefits
  remains in question; Trump wants even more money for the wall than he did a few
  months ago and he wants to address the nation on prime-time tomorrow; and the president
  of the World Bank suddenly resigned without explanation.

1/ **The White House will order the IRS to pay out income tax refunds even though almost 90 percent of its workforce is not working due to the ongoing government shutdown.** Some 12.5 percent of IRS employees are still working through the shutdown because their jobs are classified as serving "in the protection of life and property," but the agency's own shutdown contingency plan only extended until Dec. 31 and has since expired. Some IRS employees are still working to implement the sweeping Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, adding to the bureaucratic backlog as the partial government shutdown dragged into day 17.

* **Senate Democrats are considering blocking all future legislation in order to maintain focus on the government shutdown.** Chuck Schumer notified the Democratic caucus that he will only focus on bills that would reopen the government. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/politics/senate-democrats-mull-blocking-legislation-shutdown/index.html))

2/ **The Department of Agriculture won't say how long it will continue to pay out food stamps during the shutdown to the nearly 39 million people who depend on the service each month.** The program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could run out of funding in the coming weeks if Congress doesn't take action. Senior officials say the program has enough funding to cover the rest of January, but not enough for February. Congress has never let SNAP funding run out to the point where the program has defaulted on its obligations to provide benefits.

3/ **Trump's latest offer to end the shutdown includes a demand for $5.7 billion in funding "for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border,"** plus another $800 million to deal with "urgent humanitarian needs" related to unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. Democrats and Republicans made no progress in the negotiations over the weekend and the budget impasse shows no signs of coming to an end any time soon. The White House, meanwhile, refused to go into detail about how the requested funding would be spent or why the amount is larger than what the administration was asking for just a few months ago.

* **Jimmy Carter became the latest former president to deny telling Trump that he regrets not building a wall along the southern U.S. border.** "I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue," Carter said. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/424205-jimmy-carter-denies-telling-trump-he-regrets-not-building-a-border))

4/ **Trump wants to deliver a prime-time address tomorrow night to discuss the government shutdown and what he calls "the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border."** All the major networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC— confirmed that they received requests to air the broadcast during the 9 p.m. ET slot, but producers have not decided whether or not they will do so.

5/ **The president of the World Bank resigned and will leave his post at the end of the month, three years before his term was set to end.** Jim Yong Kim was appointed in 2012 by President Obama. Kim's early departure means Trump will be able to appoint his successor. The World Bank is made up of 189 nations and is the largest government source of development funding in the world. Kim gave no reason for his sudden resignation. The CEO of the World Bank, Kristalina Georgieva, will take over on an interim basis until Trump appoints a new president.
