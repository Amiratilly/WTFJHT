1/ **The FBI hasnâ€™t interviewed Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford because it doesn't have authority from the White House**, despite Trump's comment Monday that "the FBI should interview anybody that they want, within reason." The White House has indicated to the FBI that testimony from Kavanaugh and Ford is sufficient. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-03/fbi-said-to-lack-white-house-approval-to-talk-to-kavanaugh-ford))

2/ **The FBI is expected to wrap up its investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh today.** Ford has not been interviewed by the FBI. Her attorneys have demanded that the FBI interview her and other witnesses to the alleged incidents. Agents completed a first batch of interviews of four individuals closest to the alleged events, including Mark Judge, and are now interviewing Tim Gaudette, a Georgetown Preparatory School classmate of Kavanaugh who lived in the home where the July 1 party marked on Kavanaugh's 1982 calendar was held. Another friend from Kavanaugh's high school days, Chris Garrett, has also completed an FBI interview. Mitch McConnell plans to vote later this week and has vowed that "only senators will be allowed to look at" the FBI's final report.

3/ **The FBI has not contacted at least 40 potential corroborators or character witnesses about the allegations made against Kavanaugh** by Ford and Deborah Ramirez. Two sources, however, say more interviews are happening with a focus on Kavanaugh's high school friends who are listed as attending a July 1, 1982, party.

* **Kavanaugh wrote a letter to his Georgetown Prep friends in 1983 and recommended that one of them "warn the neighbors that we're loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us."**  Kavanaugh and his seven friends were staying in Ocean City, Maryland, for "Beach Week." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/us/brett-kavanaugh-georgetown-prep.html))

* **Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released an explicit statement about Julie Swetnick's sex life** by Dennis Ketterer, who said he was involved in a relationship with Swetnick in 1993. Swetnick alleges that Kavanaugh was at a house party in 1982 where she was gang raped. In his statement, Ketterer said Swetnick told him that she enjoyed group sex and had first engaged in it during high school. Ketterer said the remark "derailed" their relationship.

4/ **At a Mississippi rally Trump repeatedly mocked Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault**, for not remembering certain details when she was questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee about the incident. "How did you get home?" Trump asked the crowd. "I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What neighborhood was it in? I don't know. Where's the house? I don't know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know."

## Notables.

1. **The International Court of Justice ruled that sanctions against Iran by the U.S. violated the friendship treaty** that was signed by both countries in 1955. The United Nations' highest court ordered the U.S. to ease sanctions on Iran and to not tamper with humanitarian aid efforts by using sanctions, which are due to increase significantly next month.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders then touted Trump's economic accomplishments. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father, helped his parents dodge taxes by setting up a "sham corporation" to take improper tax deductions, and helped undervalue their real estate holdings.
