1/ **Students from more than 3,000 schools are walking out today to demand stricter gun regulation**, including bans on assault weapons and expanded background checks. The National School Walkout started at 10 a.m. ET and will continue across the country at 10 a.m. in each time zone, sparked by last month's school shooting in Florida. The protests will last for 17 minutes to honor each of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School one month ago. Some school districts have said they will discipline students who participate in the walkouts. "Change never happens without backlash," Pope High School senior Kara Litwin said. "This is a movement, this is not simply a moment, and this is only the first step in our long process."

2/ **A teacher who is also a reserve police officer injured three students after accidentally firing a gun inside a California classroom during a class devoted to public safety**. Immediately before the gun fired, Dennis Alexander told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn't loaded as he pointed it to the ceiling. "I think a lot of questions on parents' minds are, why a teacher would be pointing a loaded firearm at the ceiling in front of students," the district superintendent said. *\[Editor's note: Why would a teacher be bringing a loaded firearm to school?\]* ([KSBW](http://www.ksbw.com/article/seaside-high-teacher-accidentally-fires-gun-in-class/19426017) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/14/teacher-accidentally-discharges-firearm-in-calif-classroom-he-was-trained-in-gun-use/))

3/ **Democrat Conor Lamb is narrowly leading Republican Rick Saccone in a Pennsylvania special election that's still too close to call**. With 100% of votes counted, Lamb has a 641-vote lead over Saccone in a district that Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points and was once considered an easy win for Republicans. The district will not exist in 2019, however, after the State Supreme Court ruled in January that Pennsylvania's House map was gerrymandered unlawfully. Whoever wins will be forced to run in a new district in November.

4/ **Emails show Ben Carson and his wife selected the $31,000 furniture set for his Department of Housing and Urban Development dining room**, undercutting claims by his spokesman that he had little or no involvement in the purchase. An August email, with the subject line "Secretary's dining room set needed," refers to "printouts of the furniture the Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/emails-ben-candy-carson-dining-set/index.html))

5/ **The family of a killed DNC staffer has filed a lawsuit against Fox News**, an investigative reporter, and one of the network's frequent guests over a story about Seth Rich and their allegations that he was involved in a conspiracy.

6/ **Trey Gowdy contradicted his own Republican-led House Intelligence Committee's findings in the Russia probe**. Gowdy said Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election was motivated in part "by a desire" to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy. The committee disagreed with the intelligence community's assessment "with respect to Putin's supposed preference for candidate Trump."

### Notables.

1. **Trump floated the idea of developing a "Space Force,"** a new branch of the military that would operate outside of earth's atmosphere. The Space Force apparently started as a joke, but Trump has since decided it's "a great idea," because "space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/trump-floats-the-idea-of-creating-a-space-force-to-fight-wars-in-space.html))
