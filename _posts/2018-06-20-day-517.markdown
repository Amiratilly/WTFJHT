1/ **Trump will sign an executive order to end the separation of families at the border** and keep parents and children together in federal custody while they wait prosecution for illegal border crossings. The plan potentially violates a 1997 consent decree that prohibits the federal government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/im-ashamed-of-what-theyre-doing-backlash-grows-for-trump-and-his-aides-655498) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-leaders-voice-hope-that-bill-addressing-family-separations-will-pass-thursday/2018/06/20/cc79db9a-7480-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html))

2/ **Babies and young children separated from their families at the border are being sent to "tender age" shelters** in South Texas. Doctors and lawyers who visited the shelters described the facilities as clean and safe, but that the kids were hysterical, crying and acting out.

* **Corey Lewandowski replied "womp womp" over a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome being separated from her parents** by the Trump administration's immigration policy. Trump's former campaign manager later clarified his remark, saying he simply "mocked a liberal who attempted to politicize children as opposed to discussing the real issue which is fixing a broken immigration system." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/corey-lewandowski-girl-down-syndrome-655495))

3/ **Separating migrant children from their parents costs the Trump administration more than keeping them with their parents**. The "tent cities" to house children cost $775 per person per night, compared with $256 per person per night to hold the children in a permanent housing facility. To house children with their family costs $298 per person per night. The increased cost is due to additional security, air conditioning, medical workers, and other government contractors to staff the tent cities.

4/ **Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled by protesters who chanted "Shame!" and "End family separation!"** while having dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C. Diners at the restaurant applauded the protesters. The Homeland security secretary paid her check and was escorted out of the restaurant by Secret Service agents after 15-minutes of chanting.
