1/ **Speaker Nancy Pelosi instructed the key chairmen in the House of Representatives to begin drafting impeachment articles against Trump**, signaling that the House is likely to vote to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors before Christmas. By ordering the "chairmen" to draft the charges, Pelosi left open the possibility that the other five committees that have investigated Trump and his administration will be asked to make recommendations about articles of impeachment. Pelosi said the facts of Trump's alleged wrongdoing involving Ukraine "are uncontested" and that "the president leaves us no choice but to act." Pelosi added that Trump "abused his power for his own personal political benefit"and that his alleged wrongdoing "strikes at the very heart of our Constitution."

Barr tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with investigating the origins of the Mueller probe, as well as Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, who conservative media reports allege was a spy planted by the FBI or U.S. intelligence agencies. As part of a separate investigation, Durham was contacted by Michael Horowitz, the DOJ's inspector general, and asked whether Mifsud, who had early contact with the Trump campaign, was an intelligence asset. Durham informed Horowitz's office that his investigation had produced no evidence to support the allegation. Horowitz's report concludes that the FBI had adequate cause to launch its Russia investigation.
