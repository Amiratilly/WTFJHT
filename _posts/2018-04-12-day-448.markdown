1/ **Steve Bannon is working with White House aides and Congressional allies on a plan to cripple Robert Mueller's probe**. The plan involves firing Rod Rosenstein, refusing to cooperate with Mueller's team, and having Trump assert executive privilege "retroactively" in order to argue that Mueller's interviews with White House officials over the past year should now be null and void. Bannon also said "Ty Cobb should be fired immediately." Trump, however, tweet that he has "full confidence in Ty Cobb."

2/ **Trump's allies plan to discredit James Comey's book tour with digital advertising labeling him "Lyin' Comey"** in an effort to undermine the credibility of the former FBI director.

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/04/12/trump-touts-hannitys-show-on-deep-state-crime-families-led-by-mueller-comey-and-clintons/))

3/ **Trump tweeted that an attack on Syria "could be very soon or not soon at all!"** Trump, trying to clarify his tweet yesterday that U.S. missiles "will be coming," claimed that he "never said when an attack on Syria would take place."

5/ **A former doorman was paid $30,000 in late 2015 to sign over the rights to a story about a rumor that Trump fathered a child with an employee** in the 1980s at Trump World Tower, a skyscraper he owns near the United Nations. American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, paid Dino Sajudin to give up exclusive rights to the rumor – and then never published an article about it – five months after Trump had launched his Presidential campaign.

6/ **The company that owns the National Enquirer also paid Karen McDougal $150,000 for a story it never published**. The payout to McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate, came eight months after American Media Inc. paid $30,000 to Trump's former doorman for his story. American Media Inc. is facing a Federal Election Commission complaint claiming that the $150,000 payment represented an illegal campaign contribution. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/f37ecfc4710b468db6a103a245146172/$30,000-rumor?-Tabloid-paid-for,-spiked,-salacious-Trump-tip) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/politics/trump-national-enquirer-american-media.html))
