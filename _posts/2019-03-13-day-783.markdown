1/ **Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of 7.5 years in prison after receiving an additional 43 months on federal conspiracy charges** at his sentencing hearing in Washington, D.C. Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Manafort to 60 months in prison on the first of two criminal conspiracy counts ‚Äì 30 of those months will be served concurrently with Manafort's prior sentence in a separate case. Jackson also sentenced Manafort to 13 months of consecutive prison time on his second criminal count, for a total of 43 additional months in prison to the 47 months he was sentenced to last week in Virginia. Jackson accused Manafort of spending a "significant portion of his career gaming the system" before sentencing him to what is now the longest sentence for anyone ensnared in Mueller's nearly two-year-old probe.

* **üìå [Day 778](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/03/08/day-778/#3-paul-manafort-was-sentenced-to-les): Paul Manafort was sentenced to less than four years in jail in the first of two cases against him**. Manafort's 47 months in prison for bank and tax fraud was far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under federal sentencing guidelines. Manafort was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and restitution of just over $24 million. Judge T. S. Ellis said he thought the sentencing recommendation was "excessive," adding that he believed Manafort "lived an otherwise blameless life." It's the longest sentence to date for a Trump associate caught up in Robert Mueller's investigation. Manafort will also be sentenced next week on separate charges that he served as an unregistered foreign agent, laundered money and tampered with a witness.

2/ **New York prosecutors indicted Manafort with 16 counts related to mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records shortly after he was sentenced for federal crimes**. The new state charges against Manafort allege a scheme of falsifying business records to obtain millions of dollars in loans. Trump has not explicitly ruled out pardoning Manafort, but he can only issue pardons for federal crimes. He does not have the power to pardon state charges.

* **üìå [Day 781](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/03/11/day-781/#4-nancy-pelosi-on-impeaching-trump-h): Trump will "make his decision" on whether to pardon Paul Manafort "when he's ready,"** Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. In November, Trump said that a pardon for Manafort "was never discussed," but added that he "wouldn't take it off the table," rhetorically asking: "Why would I take it off the table?" The comment from Sanders came during the first official White House press briefing in six weeks.

3/ **The Justice Department is investigating whether a $100,000 donation to the Trump Victory committee originated from a fugitive Malaysian businessman** alleged to be at the center of a global financial scandal. It is a federal offense for foreign individuals or companies to make direct or indirect donations to U.S. politicians or fundraising committees. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-probes-whether-fugitive-financier-supplied-donation-to-trump-re-election-committee-11552482187))

4/ **Michael Flynn has all but completed his cooperation agreement with the special counsel's Russia investigation**, according to Robert Mueller. Flynn is still helping with another federal probe, according to a court filing, and attorneys for both parties cited his ongoing cooperation in that matter as justification for a delay in Flynn's sentencing. The other investigation is brought by the Eastern District of Virginia against Flynn's former business partner for unregistered lobbying on behalf of Turkey. "While the defendant remains in a position to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and could testify in the EDVA case should it proceed to trial," Mueller's latest filing reads, "in the government‚Äôs view his cooperation is otherwise complete." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn-idUSKBN1QU053))

poll/ **52% of voters are opposed to Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the southern border** ‚Äì up 1 percentage point from last month. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/13/trump-national-emergency-poll-1218483))

## Notables.

1. **Michael Cohen's attorney sent a letter to Congress in an attempt to clarify parts of Cohen's testimony, during which he claimed that he never asked Trump for a pardon.** The letter from Lanny Davis said that even though Cohen's statements were true, they could have been clearer. "In retrospect," the letter reads, "while the sentence could have been clearer regarding the time frames, the sentence is true, and Mr. Cohen stands by his statement." The letter continues: "At no time did Mr. Cohen personally ask President Trump for a pardon or did the President offer Mr. Cohen the same."
