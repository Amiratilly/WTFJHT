1/ **Trump's lead attorney dealing with the special counsel investigation resigned**. John Dowd's departure comes days after Trump called for an end to Robert Mueller's inquiry and days after Dowd said the investigation should end, initially claiming he was speaking for Trump before saying he was only speaking for himself. Trump's attorneys are in negotiations with the special counsel's team over a potential interview with Trump. It is not clear who will take over the president's legal team. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/john-dowd-resigns-trump-lawyer.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attorney-john-dowd-resigns-amid-shake-up-in-presidents-legal-team/2018/03/22/0472ce74-2de3-11e8-8688-e053ba58f1e4_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/john-dowd-white-house/index.html))

2/ **Robert Mueller's team has discussed four main topics with Trump's lawyers for a potential Trump interview**. Specifically, the special counsel wants to know about Trump's role in crafting a statement aboard Air Force One about Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump Tower; the circumstances surrounding the Trump Tower meeting; and the firings of James Comey and Michael Flynn.

3/ **House Democrats are attempting to force a vote on a bill that would protect Robert Mueller in the event that Trump tries to fire the special counsel**. Steve Cohen, a member of the House Ethics Committee, filed a petition to call for a vote on a bill called the Special Counsel Integrity Act, which would prevent anyone from firing Mueller without just cause. "Recent events particularly concern me," Cohen wrote in a statement, "because it seems the President fears that Mueller is close to revealing findings relevant to his mandate and that ending the investigation is the only way to prevent its public release."

4/ **Jeff Sessions wants prosecutors to seek the death penalty in drug-related cases whenever it's "appropriate."** The move comes less than a week after Trump called for the execution of opioid dealers and traffickers. "In the face of all of this death, we cannot continue with business as usual," Sessions wrote in a memo to U.S. Attorneys offices. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioids-deathpenalty/federal-prosecutors-told-to-seek-death-penalty-in-drug-cases-idUSKBN1GX25A?il=0))

5/ **Trump tweeted that he would beat Joe Biden in a fight** in response to Biden's suggestion that he would "beat the hell out of" Trump if they were in high school together. "Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy," Trump tweeted. "Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people Joe!" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden/index.html))

### Notables.

1. **Washington, D.C., and Maryland filed a lawsuit against Trump for violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution**, which prohibits public officials from receiving gifts and payments from foreign governments without approval from Congress. The suit claims that Trump's refusal to divest from his personal businesses has allowed foreign governments to pay the Trump Organization directly for bookings and events.
