1/ **Rudy Giuliani to Stormy Daniels: "I don't respect a porn star the way I respect a career woman or a woman of substance."** Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, called Giuliani an "absolute, disgusting pig" and demanded Trump fire him "immediately." He added that "it doesn't matter what a woman's profession is. It has nothing to do with their credibility or whether they should be respected." Giuliani defended his statement, saying: "I don't have to undermine her credibility. She's done it by lying."

2/ **The Justice Department will brief lawmakers next week about the FBI's use of an informant** in connection with its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The new offer is a concession to Republican demands for more information about the probe. The Justice Department and FBI "are prepared to brief members on certain questions specifically raised by the speaker and other members" and allow lawmakers "to review certain supporting documents that were made available during the prior briefing." Democrats are concerned that the briefings could allow Trump's legal team with access to sensitive details of the investigation.

3/ **Sean Hannity suggested that witnesses in the Robert Mueller probe "follow Hillary Clinton's lead" by destroying their personal phones before handing them over to prosecutors.** Hannity told witnesses to "delete all your emails and then acid-wash your emails and hard drives on the phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer to little itsy bitsy pieces." Hand them over to Mueller, Hannity continued, "and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law." Hannity later insisted that he was kidding.

4/ **Colin Kaepernick's lawyers plan to subpoena Trump and Pence as part of his collusion case against the NFL** in an attempt to gain information about Trump's political involvement with NFL owners.

5/ **Trump's new national security adviser has not had a Cabinet-level National Security Council meeting on North Korea after two months on the job**. In April, Trump blamed John Bolton for derailing the upcoming summit with North Korea after Bolton said the U.S. would make no concessions unless North Korea denuclearized. Trump instead has driven the preparation for the summit almost exclusively on his own, consulting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
