1/ **Two weeks before his inauguration, Trump was briefed that Putin had personally ordered the cyberattacks to influence the 2016 election**. The intelligence briefing included texts and emails from Russian military officers, as well as evidence from a source close to Putin, who had described how the Kremlin executed the hacking and disinformation campaign. After flip-flopping on whether he believed Putin's denial that Russia interfered in the election, Trump indirectly blamed Putin for meddling, "because he's in charge of the country." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html))

2/ **Trump now "disagrees" with Putin's "incredible offer" to allow Moscow to interrogate 11 Americans in exchange for access to the 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted for their role in trying to sabotage the 2016 election**, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders. [Yesterday](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/18/trump-russia-browder-mcfaul-questioning-731616), the White House said Trump was entertaining Putin's proposal to swap officials for questioning, calling it "an interesting idea," which prompted a [backlash](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-condemn-white-house-suggestion-kremlin-interrogate-us/story?id=56687264) from both Republicans and Democrats. It took Trump three days to come this conclusion. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-to-vote-on-urging-trump-to-reject-putins-request-to-interrogate-mcfaul/2018/07/19/db133978-8b71-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/politics/trump-putin-browder-mcfaul.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-interviews/white-house-rejects-putin-proposal-to-interview-u-s-citizens-idUSKBN1K92PP))

* **The Senate unanimously approved a non-binding, bipartisan resolution warning Trump not to honor Putin's request** to let the Russian government question American diplomats and other officials.

3/ **Russia's ambassador to the U.S. claimed Trump and Putin had reached several "important verbal agreements"** on issues in the Middle East and nuclear proliferation, but senior U.S. military have little to no information about what the two leaders discussed or agreed to. Although details from his first summit with Putin remain unclear, Trump has already tweeted that he is looking "forward to our [second meeting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hes-looking-forward-to-second-summit-with-putin/2018/07/19/450a0424-8b59-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html) so we can start implementing some of the many things discussed." Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Trump asked John Bolton, national security advisor, to invite Putin to Washington for a second summit this fall.

5/ **FBI Director Christopher Wray: Russia is the "most aggressive actor" in election interference** and is "very active" at "sowing discord and divisiveness in this country." Wray added: "My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day."

([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/sean-spicer-mueller-s-investigation-not-witch-hunt-n892671))

* **Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed she hasn't "seen evidence" that Russia tried to swing the 2016 election** in Trump's favor. DHS later clarified her comments, saying she "agrees with" the U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia tampered with the election.

6/ **New York State is investigating whether the Trump Foundation violated state tax laws**. The investigation by the Department of Taxation and Finance will focus on some of the same issues as the New York attorney general's lawsuit: campaign finance violations, self-dealing, and illegal coordination with the Trump campaign. If the investigation finds possible criminal activity, it could refer the findings to the state attorney general or a district attorney. Trump's tax returns could possibly be revealed as part of a criminal investigation.
