1/ **Mitch McConnel said he supports the Mueller investigation and that nothing in Thursday's secret briefing on the Russia probe changed his mind.** "The two investigations going on that I think will give us the answers to the questions that you raise â€” the \[inspector general\] investigation in the Justice Department and the Mueller investigation," McConnell said. "I support both of them, and I don't really have anything to add to this subject based upon the Gang of Eight briefing that we had today, which was classified."

* **After a closed-door briefing with top Justice Department officials, Congressional Democrats said there is "no evidence" that the FBI placed a spy in the Trump campaign.** "Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols," said Adam Schiff.

2/ **The head of the national Border Patrol union called Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border "a colossal waste of resources."** Roughly 1,600 National Guard troops were deployed to the border in April. "We have seen no benefit," said union president Brandon Judd. Another 750 troops may soon be added to fill support roles and the total deployment could reach nearly 4,000 troops, according to Army Lt. Col. Jamie Davis.

3/ **Trump wanted to call off the North Korean summit before Kim Jong Un could beat him to the punch.** "There was no hint of this yesterday," said a person briefed on the summit preparations. Defense Secretary James Mattis was not involved in the discussions on Wednesday about canceling the meeting, but Trump said he called Mattis about it Thursday morning. The decision happened so quickly that the White House was unable to give congressional leaders and key allies advance notice, and the letter to Kim was sent out while more than two dozen foreign journalists and several U.S. citizens were still inside North Korea covering the demolition of a nuclear test site. "He's not taking the guy's shit," said a friend of Trump, who described the move as just another exercise in "the art of the deal."

4/ **Mueller's team has been investigating Roger Stone's finances as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians** during the 2016 presidential election. Mueller has questioned Stone's associates about his finances, including his tax returns. Stone claims he has not been contacted by the special counsel's office, and that he played no role in colluding with Russia.

5/ **Roger Stone tried to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton from Julian Assange during the 2016 campaign**. Emails reveal that Stone used a mutual acquaintance as an intermediary between himself and Assange in order to ask Assange for any emails related to Clinton's role in disrupting a purported peace deal in Libya while she was serving as Obama's secretary of state in 2011. Stone testified last year that he had only "wanted confirmation" that Assange had information about Clinton in his possession.

6/ **A turf war between Jared Kushner and Jeff Sessions drove the director of the federal prison system to resign.** Mark Inch told Rod Rosenstein that he was tired of administration officials flouting "departmental norms," and complained that Sessions had excluded him from major staffing, budget, and policy decisions. Inch also felt excluded by Kushner when it came to drafting prison reform legislation. Sessions and Kushner had been at odds over proposed changes to federal prisons policies, and Inch's constantly dwindling role in the deliberations played a big part in his decision to quit last week.

7/ **Trump nominated immigration hard-liner Ronald Mortensen to become the next assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.** Mortensen has been highly critical of the DACA program. Among other things, Mortensen has claimed that "Illegal aliens commit felonies in order to get jobs," that "illegal immigration and high levels of identity theft go hand-in-hand," and that "children are prime targets" of identity theft committed by undocumented immigrants. Mortensen's job description, if he is confirmed, would be to provide "protection, ease suffering, and resolve the plight of persecuted and uprooted people around the world on behalf of the American people."

### NOTABLES.

Viktor Vekselberg met with Cohen to discuss their mutual desire to improve Russia's relationship with the U.S. under the incoming Trump administration.

2. **Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to police and was arrested by the NYPD on charges of rape, criminal sex acts, and other lower level sex abuse and sexual misconduct charges**.

"At a certain point," Evans said, "you have to think about the greater good of humanity, of womankind."
