1/ **Rudy Giuliani: Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for the $130,000 hush payment to Stormy Daniels**, repaying Cohen through a series of payments over several months until the transactions were completed either in 2017 or early 2018. "The president repaid it," Giuliani told Sean Hannity, but Trump "didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this with my clients." Giuliani said that Cohen had "settled several problems for" Trump, and the payment was one of them.

2/ **Giuliani's comments directly contradicted Trump's earlier statement that he didn't know of any payments to Stormy Daniels** or where Cohen got the money when asked by reporters last month aboard Air Force One.

3/ **Trump tweeted that campaign funds "played no roll in this transaction" — misspelling the word "role."** Trump and Giuliani both argued that the Stormy Daniels money came from Trump's personal funds. Legal experts say the transaction could be considered an in-kind campaign political contribution since it came right before the election – which the Trump team never reported – making it subject to campaign finance laws. Trump tweeted that he paid Cohen a monthly retainer, which means that the payment by Cohen to Daniels could not be considered a campaign contribution. "The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair," Trump tweeted, "despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair." Later, Giuliani said, "this was never about the campaign. This was about personal reputation. The money wasn't paid to help the campaign or hurt the campaign."

* **Kellyanne Conway's husband tweeted the Federal Election Commission's personal gifts and loans rules**, which states that "If any person, including a relative or friend of the candidate, gives or loans the candidate money 'for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office,' the funds are not considered personal funds of the candidate even if they are given to the candidate directly. Instead, the gift or loan is considered a contribution from the donor to the campaign, subject to the per-election limit and reportable by the campaign. This is true even if the candidate uses the funds for personal living expenses while campaigning."

4/ **Giuliani: The special counsel's request for an interview is an effort to "trap" Trump "into perjury, and we're not suckers."** Giuliani added the Robert Mueller's "silly deposition is about a case in which he supposedly colluded with the Russians but there's no evidence" and that Jeff Sessions "should step in and close it and say enough is enough." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/were-not-suckers-giuliani-says-he-wont-let-mueller-trap-trump-into-perjury/2018/05/03/65e0465c-4ebb-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html))

* **Giuliani also called Jared Kushner "disposable" and warned that Mueller should stay away from Ivanka Trump**, saying "the whole country will turn on" the special counsel. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/rudy-giuliani-said-trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-is-disposable.html))

5/ **The FBI wiretapped Cohen's phone lines and intercepted at least one call between a Cohen line and the White House**. The wiretap was in place before the April 9th raid on Cohen's home, hotel room, and office. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/feds-tapped-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-s-phones-n871011) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/feds-tapped-phones-of-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-and-caught-one-call-with-white-house-nbc-news.html))

6/ **Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo said it's clear that Mueller's team is "still really focused on Russia collusion,"** adding that Mueller's team knows "more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there." Caputo was interviewed this week behind closed doors by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/politics/michael-caputo-mueller-investigator/index.html))

7/ **Mueller is focusing on alleged interactions between Rick Gates and Roger Stone during the campaign**. Stone is a subject in Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Stone publicly praised the hacker who claimed to have broken into the DNC's servers in 2016 and had dinner with Julian Assange — the founder of Wikileaks, which published the emails — in August 2016. The link between Gates and Stone goes back to their work at a D.C. lobbying firm, which was founded by Stone and Paul Manafort.
