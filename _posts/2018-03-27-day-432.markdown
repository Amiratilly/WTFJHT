1/ **The 2020 census will ask respondents if they are United States citizens, despite concerns from the Census Bureau**. Inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond, resulting in an undercount of the population, which would effect government agencies and groups that rely on the census data. The effects could also effect redistricting of the House and state legislatures over the next decade. It's been 70 years since the government has included a question about citizenship on the census.

2/ **California sued the Trump administration, arguing that the question about citizenship in the 2020 Census violates the U.S. Constitution**. The Constitution requires a census every 10 years to count the "number of free persons" in each state. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra alleges the change violates the constitutional requirement of "actual Enumeration" of every person in every state, every 10 years, and that "California simply has too much to lose for us to allow the Trump Administration to botch this important decennial obligation."
