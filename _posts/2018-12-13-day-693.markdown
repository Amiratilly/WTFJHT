1/ **Maria Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent**. Butina acted "under direction of" a senior Russian official to influence U.S. politics as an agent for the Kremlin from 2015 until her arrest in July in an effort to establish "unofficial lines of communication" with influential Americans in the NRA and in the Republican Party under the direction of a former Russian senator and deputy governor of Russia's central bank, which matches the description of sanctioned Russian central banker Alexander Torshin. Butina is also expected to provide evidence against Paul Erickson, who helped her with what she called her "Diplomacy Project." Butina faces up to five years in prison but is expected to only serve six months based on "the sentencing guidelines cited as part of the plea agreement."

2/ **Trump claimed he "never directed Michael Cohen to break the law"** and said he isn't responsible for any crimes because he acted on the "advice of counsel" and his former lawyer is "supposed to know the law." Trump also questioned whether any campaign finance violations even occurred, saying "Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me \[...\] which were not criminal and of which he probably was not guilty even on a civil basis." Trump suggested that Cohen pleaded guilty to the charges in order to "embarrass" him and to get a reduced prison term. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to violating campaign finance law when he made hush money payments ahead of the 2016 election to Stormy Daniels and arranged a similar pay-off to Karen McDougal at the direction of then-candidate Trump, which were intended to sway the election.

* **Trump claimed that Robert Mueller's prosecutors gave Michael Flynn "a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated."** Mueller recommended Flynn serve no jail time due to his "substantial assistance" in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election after the former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. last December.

3/ **Two Michael Flynn associates said he discussed a deal with Sergey Kislyak during the campaign about how Trump and Russia could work together if Trump won**. According to Flynn's associates, the bargain he discussed with Russia's then-ambassador to the U.S. was that Moscow would cooperate with the Trump administration to resolve the Syrian conflict and in exchange the U.S. would end or ease sanctions imposed on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine. In mid-August 2016, Trump and Flynn received a briefing that noted the intelligence community had reached the preliminary conclusion that Moscow was behind the hacks of Democratic targets and the public disclosure of the stolen material. Flynn's "series of contacts" with Kislyak continued despite knowing Moscow was behind the efforts to subvert the U.S. election.

* **ðŸ“Œ The Re-Up: [Day 25](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/13/Day-25/#1-michael-flynn-resigns-as-national): Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser after it was revealed that he had misled Pence** and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn served in the job for less than a month. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html))

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 26](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/14/Day-26/#2-trump-knew-flynn-misled-officials): Trump knew Flynn misled officials on Russia calls for "weeks,"** the White House says. The comment contrasts the impression Trump gave aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a report that revealed Flynn had not told the truth about the calls. White House counsel Don McGahn told Trump in a January briefing that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/14/trump-was-told-weeks-ago-that-flynn-misled-vice-president-about-russia-contacts-white-house-says/))

* **ðŸ“Œ [Day 22](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/10/Day-22/#4-national-security-adviser-flynn-di): Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials**. Flynn's communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

4/ **Trump canceled the White House holiday party for members of the media**, ending the decades-long tradition as his contentious relationship with the media continues to escalate. There was no announcement from the White House stating that the event was canceled. ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cancels-white-house-christmas-party-for-the-press))

poll/ **48% of Americans have confidence in the Democrats in Congress to deal with the major issues facing the country today**, compared with 39% who said they have confidence in Trump, and 9% who say they don't trust either.
