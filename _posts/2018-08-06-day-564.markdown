1/ **Trump admitted that the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer was to get dirt on Hillary Clinton**. "This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!" Trump's tweet contradicted Trump Jr.'s original statement about the meeting – which was dictated by Trump – that the the meeting was to discuss the adoption of Russian children.

2/ **Trump told confidants that he is worried about how the Robert Mueller probe could impact Trump Jr.'s life**. Mueller is investigating Trump Jr.'s role in organizing the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. One adviser said Trump doesn't believe his son intentionally broke the law, but that Trump Jr. may have inadvertently wandered into legal ­jeopardy. Trump tweeted that his concern about Trump Jr.'s potential legal exposure from the meeting was "Fake News reporting" and "a complete fabrication." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-at-a-precarious-moment-in-his-presidency-privately-brooding-and-publicly-roaring/2018/08/04/4b463842-9736-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-total-fabrication-concerned-son-legal-trouble-russia/story?id=57043917))

* **Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley this week said that if Trump Jr. "misled the committee, he's lying to Congress.** That's a crime. And that'd be up to the prosecutors, not me." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/04/politics/trump-concerned-trump-jr-mueller/index.html))

* **Why this weekend's Trump Tower tweet matters**. The tweet comes at a time when Trump is increasingly anxious about Robert Mueller's investigation and how it may impact him and his family. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/06/politics/trump-tower-tweet/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ap-explains-why-the-2016-trump-tower-meeting-matters/2018/08/06/9700fc66-9995-11e8-a8d8-9b4c13286d6b_story.html))

3/ **Documents from Trump's voter fraud commission "do not contain evidence of widespread voter fraud,"** according to Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, one of the panel's 11 members. Dunlap said that after reading through more than 8,000 pages of documents, "the goal of the commission seems to have been to validate \[Trump's\] claims" "that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally." The panel was disbanded in January and the White House claimed at the time that despite "substantial evidence of voter fraud," the commission was shut down due to legal challenges from states. The panel never presented any findings or evidence of widespread voter fraud. Kris Kobach, the commission's vice chair, however, said at the time that the panel was shut down because "some people on the left were getting uncomfortable about how much we were finding out." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/03/the-most-bizarre-thing-ive-ever-been-a-part-of-trump-panel-found-no-voter-fraud-ex-member-says/))

* **Trump tweeted that Kris Kobach has his "full and total Endorsement!" for governor of Kansas**, despite warnings from aides that it would alienate Republicans loyal to incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer. Kobach is an advocate of stricter voter identification laws in his state, including a requirement that new voters provide proof of citizenship when they register, which a federal judge recently struck down. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/9dc2ed42fbc74738a6c12d1a06c9060a/Trump-breaks-with-aides,-tweets-endorsement-of-Kobach) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/06/635850525/kobachs-polarizing-views-may-not-hurt-his-chances-of-becoming-governor-of-kansas) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/06/trump-endorses-kris-kobach-kansas-primary-764818))

4/ **Trump signed an executive order to reimpose several sanctions against Iran.** Three months after unilaterally pulling the U.S. out of the "horrible, one-sided" Iran Nuclear Deal, Trump said today's move is mean to exert "maximum economic pressure" against Iran. Trump also warned all other countries "to make clear that the Iranian regime faces a choice: either change its threatening, destabilizing behavior and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/d91a8e71b45b456a97f6a633a391a0c4/The-Latest:-Trump-reinstates-many-sanctions-on-Iran))

5/ **Two of the largest American steel companies, both of which have deep ties to the Trump administration, successfully objected to hundreds of tariff exemption requests by American companies that buy foreign steel.** Nucor and United States Steel objected to 1,600 exemption requests filed with the Commerce Department over the last several months, arguing that companies should not be exempt from the tariffs because the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers. The Trump administration established a process for companies to request "exclusions" from the metal tariffs, but the Commerce Department also allowed American companies to challenge exclusion requests. Not a single exclusion challenge by the two companies has failed to date. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/nucor-us-steel-tariff-exemptions.html))

6/ **A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must fully restore the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program**, setting a 20-day deadline for the administration to do so. DC District Judge John Bates said the Trump administration failed to justify its proposal to end DACA and that its rationale for dropping the program was inadequate. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/03/635546997/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-fully-restore-daca) / [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/federal-judge-rules-that-daca-must-be-restarted/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/politics/daca-ruling/index.html))

## Notables.

1. **A district judge has struck down a Federal Election Commission rule that allowed for anonymous donations to "dark money" groups**. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the FEC regulation allowing for those donors to remain anonymous fell below the standard that Congress meant to set when it passed laws on disclosing the sources of political donations. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/04/campaigns-dark-money-groups-donors-anonymous-ruling-762440))

2. **Maria Butina, the alleged Russian spy, socialized with a former Trump campaign aide weeks before the 2016 election**. At the time, J.D. Gordon planned to join Trump's transition team, but ultimately never did. From March 2016 until August 2016, Gordon was the point person for an advisory group on foreign policy and national security for the Trump campaign. Paul Erickson, a GOP operative with whom Butina was in a romantic relationship, told her that Gordon was "playing a crucial role in the Trump transition effort and would be an excellent addition to any of the U.S./Russia friendship dinners to occasionally hold." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-associate-socialized-with-alleged-russian-agent-maria-butina-in-final-weeks-of-2016-campaign/2018/08/03/d87c1d84-96a6-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/us/politics/maria-butina-nra-russia-influence.html))

3. **The DNC warned Democrats running in November's midterms not to use devices by Chinese manufacturers ZTE and Huawei**. Top officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Defense Intelligence Agency all testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in February that the Chinese smartphones makers posed a security threat to American customers. ([CNN](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/03/technology/democratic-national-committee-zte-huawei/index.html))

4. **The Newseum stopped selling the "You Are Very Fake News" T-shirts from its store**. The online store is still selling "Make America Great Again" hats. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/04/newseum-fake-news-shirt-backlash-762443))
