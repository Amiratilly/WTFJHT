1/ **Robert Mueller has at least 49 questions he wants to ask Trump regarding his ties to Russia and alleged obstruction**. The questions deal primarily with Trump's firing of James Comey and Michael Flynn, as well as his treatment of Jeff Sessions and the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Other topics of inquiry include Trump's conversations with Michael Cohen about a real estate deal in Moscow, Jared Kushner's attempts to set up a backchannel to Russia, contacts Trump had with Roger Stone, and Trump's 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant.

2/ **Trump tweets: "So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were 'leaked' to the media."** The leak didn't come from Mueller's office, but were provided to the New York Times by a person outside of Trump's legal team. "No questions on Collusion," Trump added. "Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!" The list includes 13 questions related to possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump followed up with another tweet 45 minutes later: "It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!"([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/so-disgraceful-trump-lashes-out-at-publication-of-special-counsel-questions/2018/05/01/f3796a9e-4c7b-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/01/trump-new-york-times-mueller-561692))

3/ **Grammatical errors point to Trump as the source who leaked the list of Mueller's questions**. "Lawyers wouldn't write questions this way, in my estimation," said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former assistant to Robert Mueller. "Some of the grammar is not even proper," he continued. "I think these are more notes that the White House has taken and then they have expanded upon the conversation to write out these as questions."

* **Nixon's White House counsel said that if the Trump administration leaked Mueller's questions it could qualify as obstruction of justice**. John Dean said leaking the questions could be an attempt to "try to disrupt the flow of information" or tip off a witness.

4/ **Trump allies in the House have drafted articles of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein**. One author of the draft articles referred to them as a "last resort." They are not expected to garner much support. The last federal official to be impeached by the House was federal judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., who was convicted on bribery allegations by the Senate in 2010.

5/ **Trump's bodyguard and a Trump Organization lawyer took the original and only copy of Trump's medical chart from his doctor in February 2017** after Dr. Harold Bornstein told the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-prostate-drug-hair-harold-bornstein.html) that Trump takes Propecia. Keith Schiller, who was serving as director of Oval Office operations, also took lab reports under Trump's name as well as under the pseudonyms the office used for Trump. Bornstein said he was not given a form authorizing the release of the records, which is a violation of patient privacy law.

* **The White House pushed back on claims that Dr. Ronny Jackson is no longer Trump's personal physician**, despite reports that Jackson will not return to his previous role as physician to the president now that he has withdrawn his nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/385474-white-house-pushes-back-on-reports-of-jacksons-ouster-as-trumps))

6/ **Mike Pence's physician privately warned the White House in September that Ronny Jackson may have violated the federal privacy protections of Karen Pence and intimidated the vice president's doctor**. The previously unreported incident is the first sign that the White House knew about Jackson's misconduct months before Trump and his staff defended Jackson's professionalism and insisted that he had been thoroughly vetted. The incident is also the first allegation of medical misconduct by Jackson, adding to a long line of other allegations against the former White House physician.
