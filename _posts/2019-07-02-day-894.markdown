1/ **House Democrats sued for Trump's tax returns**, challenging the administration's refusal to comply with a subpoena for the records. The Ways and Means Committee accused the Trump administration of "an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight," naming the Treasury Department, IRS, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in the suit. The Trump administration has argued that Congress's power to access the returns is limited to information that would serve "legitimate" legislative purposes.

2/ **The Trump administration dropped its plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census** after the Supreme Court effectively blocked the addition of the question, calling the rationale for the question "contrived." After the ruling was announced last week, Trump said he was considering delaying the census until the question could be added. The process of preparing a new justification, however, was expected to take months and delay the process of printing hundreds of millions of forms.

* **The Trump administration missed its own July 1st deadline to print the 2020 census**. The materials have yet to be officially approved by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which is headed by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

3/ **The Department of Homeland Security sent out fines for nearly $500,000 to some immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally** for "failing to depart the U.S. as previously agreed." ICE said the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the agency the right to impose "civil fines on aliens who have been ordered removed or granted voluntary departure and fail to depart the United States" of no more than $500 for each day the person is in violation of the section. Immigration lawyers say they've never heard of it used this way. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738059913/trump-administration-sends-out-notices-of-500-000-fines-for-those-in-u-s-illegal))

4/ **Trump threatened to increase ICE raids and deportations of undocumented immigrants after the Fourth of July holiday**, saying "they're going to be gone, they're going back to their countries. They go back home." Trump praised the Mexican government for taking steps to curb the flow of migrants reaching the U.S. border, claiming, "It was because of tariffs that they're doing it, but the point is they're doing a great job." Trump then reiterated his threat to deport all undocumented immigrants, "because that's what we do." Trump [delayed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/06/24/day-886/#2-trump-delayed-planned-nationwide-i) planned nationwide ICE raids last month for two weeks to see if Congress can "work out a solution."

* **Rep. Joaquin Castro snuck a hidden camera into a migrant detention facility and tweeted out photos and videos**, saying Americans "must see what is being carried out in their name." The tweets show several women in the custody of Customs and Border Patrol sitting on the floor with blankets at a facility in El Paso. The facility in question housed "women from Cuba, some grandmothers, crammed into a prison-like cell with one toilet, but no running water to drink from or wash their hands with. Concrete floors, cinder-block walls, steel toilets." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also visited the facility, where she said officers were keeping women in cells with no running water, and had "told them to drink out of the toilets."

5/ **Tanks for Trump's Fourth of July "Salute to America" arrived in Washington**. At least two Bradley and two Abrams tanks were purportedly en route to the National Mall. Trump also requested that the chiefs for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines stand next to him during the celebration.

6/ **Ivanka Trump was an unofficial stand-in for diplomats and government officials at meetings with world leaders** at the G-20 summit, in South Korea, and at the demilitarized zone. Ivanka called the experience "surreal."
