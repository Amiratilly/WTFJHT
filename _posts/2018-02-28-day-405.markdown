1/ **ICE arrested more than 150 suspected undocumented immigrants in the Bay Area**, two days after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf publicly warned of imminent ICE raids in Northern California. ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan called Schaaf's decision "reckless" and that "864 criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large." Schaaf said she didn't regret sharing the information, calling it her "ethical obligation" and that "It is Oakland's legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws. We believe our community is safer when families stay together."

2/ **Trump attacked Jeff Sessions on Twitter for his "disgraceful" handling of an investigation into potential surveillance abuses**. "Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc," Trump tweeted. "Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!" Yesterday, Sessions announced that the Justice Department is looking at whether the FBI properly handled FISA applications to monitor members of his transition team.
