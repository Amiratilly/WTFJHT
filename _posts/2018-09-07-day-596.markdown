1/ **Trump will not answer Robert Mueller's questions about obstruction of justice**, according to Rudy Giuliani. "That's a no-go. That is not going to happen," Trump's lawyer said. "There will be no questions at all on obstruction," whether in person or in writing. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/fd82c9d1dab7431db1635d9473c3d30e))

2/ **Hours later Giuliani walked back the comments, saying answering questions about obstruction of justice are "not ruled in or out."** One person with direct knowledge of the Trump's legal strategy said "there is no strategy" aside from PR tactics of threatening Mueller. If negotiations break down, Mueller could be forced to subpoena Trump to testify. Giuliani previously said they would fight any subpoena to the Supreme Court, which has never definitively ruled on the question of whether a president can be forced to testify.

3/ **Elizabeth Warren called on White House officials to invoke the 25th Amendment and begin the process of removing Trump from office.** "If senior administration officials think the President of the United States is not able to do his job," Warren said, "then they should invoke the 25th Amendment." Warren's comments come a day after an op-ed by an anonymous senior administration official who attacked Trump's "amorality" and "anti-democratic" policies, saying staff is "thwarting" Trump's "misguided impulses" and "worst inclinations."

4/ **Trump told his supporters it'll be "your fault" if he gets impeached. **During a rally in Montana, Trump told supporters that they "aren't just voting for a candidate, you are voting for which party controls Congress." He then brought up "the impeachment word" and said "you didn't go out to vote -- that's the only way it could happen."

## Notables.

1. **George Papadopoulos will be sentenced today after pleading guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians**. Papadopoulos was the first campaign adviser to be arrested in connection with Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. He faces up to six months in prison. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/papadopoulos-sentenced-russia-investigation/story?id=57658992))

2. **Trump "most likely" won't "shut down government over border security" after all**. Trump has gone back and forth about the possibility of a government shutdown, and recently said he'd prefer to wait until after the midterms because "we need Republicans elected in the midterms. We are getting the wall done."
