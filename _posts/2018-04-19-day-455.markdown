1/ **Michael Cohen dropped a pair of libel suits against BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS over the publication of the dossier** that details alleged ties between Trump and Russia. The dossier claims Cohen met with Russian operatives somewhere in Europe to "clean up the mess" created by the public disclosures of Trump associates' ties to Russia. Pursuing the suit would require Cohen to "face a discovery process that would have forced him to defend his reputation and address the allegations of the Steele dossier under penalty of perjury."

2/ **Trump's legal advisers warned that Michael Cohen would flip and cooperate with federal prosecutors if faced with criminal charges**. "They're going to threaten him with a long prison term and try to turn him into a canary that sings," Alan Dershowitz said, who met with Trump and his staff over two days at the White House last week. Jay Goldberg, who represented Trump in the 1990s and early 2000s, told the president not to trust Cohen, and on a scale of 100 to 1, where 100 is fully protecting the president, Cohen "isn't even a 1."

3/ **Trump's allies threatened to impeach Rod Rosenstein** if he didn't provide them with documents about the FBI's conduct related to the Russia probe and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan said Rosenstein could also be held in contempt of Congress if he doesn't satisfy their demands for documents. Critics say the two Republicans are attempting to build a case against Rosenstein in the hopes of closing the Mueller investigation.

4/ **Trump: We'll put sanctions on Russia "as soon as they very much deserve it,"** adding that "there has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump." The third-person comment capped a four-day stretch of confusion over whether the Trump administration would punish Moscow for its role in a recent chemical attack in Syria.
