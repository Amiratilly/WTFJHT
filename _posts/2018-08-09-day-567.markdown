1/ **Mike Pence detailed Trump's proposal to create a "Space Force" as the sixth branch of the U.S. military by 2020.** Pence said the creation of the Space Force, the first new branch of the military since 1947, represented a response to new and emerging threats. The new  branch would require a significant reorganization of the Department of Defense and how it handles space operations. Pence said that the U.S. must not only increase its involvement in space-related affairs, but that "we must have American dominance in space." After the announcement, Trump tweeted: "Space Force all the way!"

3/ **Devin Nunes was caught on a secret recording explaining that the effort to impeach Rod Rosenstein had stalled because it would delay the Senate's confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.** "So if we actually vote to impeach, OK," Nunes said, "what that does is that triggers the Senate then has to take it up." He continued: "The Senate would have to drop everything they're doing ... and start with impeachment on Rosenstein. And then take the risk of not getting Kavanaugh confirmed." Nunes reiterated his belief that Rosenstein should be impeached, but said that "the question is the timing of it right before the election." He also warned that "if Sessions wonâ€™t unrecuse and Mueller wonâ€™t clear the president, weâ€™re the only ones" protecting Trump from the Mueller investigation.
