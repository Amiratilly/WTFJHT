* ## Day Six.

* **Gates details tax and financial schemes**. Gates detailed how his ex-boss Paul Manafort used a web of offshore companies to receive tens of millions of dollars in payments from wealthy Ukrainian businessmen.

* **With his income drying up in 2015, Manafort was upset when he learned he would owe $215,000 in taxes** for income he reported in 2014. He wrote to Gates: "How could I be blindsided like this. You told me you were on top of this. We need to discuss options. This is a disaster." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/us/politics/manafort-trial-gates-testimony.html))

* ## Day Five.

* ðŸš¨ **Rick Gates testified that he and Paul Manafort committed crimes together and held 15 foreign bank accounts that were not disclosed to the federal government**.

Gates testified that Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian who Mueller's team alleges had ties to Russian intelligence during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, had signatory authority over some of Manafort's accounts in Cyprus.
