1. **Devin Nunes was caught on a secret recording explaining that the effort to impeach Rod Rosenstein had stalled because it would delay the Senate's confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.** "So if we actually vote to impeach, OK," Nunes said, "what that does is that triggers the Senate then has to take it up." He continued: "The Senate would have to drop everything they're doing ... and start with impeachment on Rosenstein. And then take the risk of not getting Kavanaugh confirmed." Nunes reiterated his belief that Rosenstein should be impeached, but said that "the question is the timing of it right before the election." He also warned that "if Sessions won’t unrecuse and Mueller won’t clear the president, we’re the only ones" protecting Trump from the Mueller investigation.
