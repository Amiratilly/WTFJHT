1. **The White House economic adviser said the Trump administration wants to end federal subsidies and tax credits for electric cars and renewable energy sources.** Larry Kudlow predicted that the subsidies would be gone within the next few years. "It’s just all going to end in the near future," Kudlow said. "I don’t know whether it will end in 2020 or 2021." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-idUSKBN1O22D4))

2. **Robert Mueller is expected to recommend a sentence for Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.**  Mueller's recommendation will come in the form of a court filing, which is also expected to include more details about the extent of Flynn's cooperation with the special counsel in the Russia probe. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. He will be sentenced by a federal judge on Dec. 18.

3. **Paul Manafort tried to get Ecuador to hand over Julian Assange in exchange for debt relief from the United States.** Manafort originally flew to Ecuador in May 2017 to convince then-incoming President Lenín Moreno to let Manafort broker an energy deal between China and Ecuador. But the talks shifted to Ecuador's desire to rid itself of Assange, who has been staying the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012. Manafort suggested that he could negotiate a deal for the handover of Assange, but the deal quickly fell apart once it became clear that Manafort was a major target of Mueller's Russia investigation. There is no evidence that Trump was aware of or involved in Manafort's dealings with Ecuador.

4. **Michael Cohen wants to get on with his sentencing process as soon as he can so he can start serving his time.** "He realizes that he needs to move on with his life, and that he’d like to begin that process as soon as possible," said Cohen's friend and fellow attorney. Cohen also told his friends that he doesn't understand why he is taking the fall for the things he did on Trump's behalf while Trump has yet to face any legal consequences.

5. **Mike Pompeo told a room full of NATO ministers that Trump is building a "new liberal order" based on US leadership and the principle of national sovereignty over multilateralism.** Pompeo also said the EU, UN, World Bank, and the IMF were no longer serving the respective missions, and that Trump's "America First" policy would make them function better. "In the finest traditions of our great democracy, we are rallying the noble nations of the world to build a new liberal order that prevents war and achieves greater prosperity for all," Pompeo said during his speech. "We’re supporting institutions that we believe can be improved; institutions that work in American interests – and yours – in service of our shared values."
