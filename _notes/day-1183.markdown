1. **Trump threatened to adjourn both chambers of Congress if the Senate doesn't confirm his nominees for various openings across his administration.** Trump warned that Congress should "either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so I can make recess appointments." Lawmakers aren't expected to return to Capitol Hill until May 4, but the House and Senate have both been conducting pro forma sessions while they're out. Trump called the practice of "leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions" a "scam" and a "dereliction of duty." U.S. presidents have the power under Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution to convene either or both chambers of Congress "on extraordinary occasions" or adjourn them "to such time as he shall think proper." No president has ever exercised that authority. There are, however, procedural rules in the Senate that would require consent from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in order to allow Trump to go through with the adjournment.
