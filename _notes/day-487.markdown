1. **The RNC paid roughly half-a-million dollars to a law firm representing former White House communications director Hope Hicks and others involved in the Russia probe**. Trout Cacheris & Janis received $451,780 from the RNC after Hicks hired the firm's founder as her personal attorney in September. The money used to pay the firm was originally meant to be used for election recounts and other legal matters, but RNC officials concluded that the money could be used to pay for the president's legal fees.
