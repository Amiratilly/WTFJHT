1. **The Trump administration rejected an intelligence report last year that showed refugees do not post a significant security threat to the United States.** Hardliners inside the White House then issued their own report earlier this year that misstated the evidence and inflated the threat posed by those who were born outside the country.

2. **Trump said he would  be willing to shut down the government at the end of the month if Democrats don't provide enough funding for border security, reversing his position from the day before.** On Tuesday, Trump said, "I don’t see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now." On Wednesday, Trump responded to a reporter's question about a government shutdown by saying, "If it happens, it happens. If it’s about border security, I’m willing to do anything. We have to protect our borders." Mitch McConnell said there was "no chance" of a government shutdown.
