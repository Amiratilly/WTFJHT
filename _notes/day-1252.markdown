1. **More than 13,000 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service workers could face extended furloughs starting on August 3 unless the agency receives additional funding from Congress.** The fees from visa and citizenship applications and other services have dropped significantly since the coronavirus pandemic began, causing the funding for USCIS operations to fall accordingly. Three-fourths of the USCIS workforce would see their salaries and hours cut for up to 30 days or longer. The agency said it needs an additional $1.2 billion infusion over the rest of the fiscal year, plus a 10% surcharge on application fees, in order to stay afloat.

2. **Black Lives Matter protests across the country have not led to an increase in coronavirus cases, according to a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research.** The study looked at protests from more than 300 of the largest American cities and found no evidence that cases of COVID-19 increased in the weeks after the demonstrations. Researchers found that social distancing measures actually went up in the wake of the protests.

All seven states are experiencing thousands of new cases and hospitalizations. California and Texas saw 5,000 new cases in a single day on Tuesday.

4. **65 faculty members from Attorney General William Barr's law school wrote a letter saying Barr has "failed to fulfill his oath of office to 'support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'"** The bipartisan group of law professors and other faculty from George Washington University also wrote that Barr's actions as AG have "undermined the rule of law, breached constitutional norms, and damaged the integrity and traditional independence of his office and of the Department of Justice." The letter was posted amid the fallout over Barr's firing of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/politics/george-washington-law-william-barr/index.html))
