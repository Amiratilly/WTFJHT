1. **Eleven newly released top-secret cables from the time CIA director Gina Haspel oversaw a CIA black site in Thailand provide graphic details about how the agency tortured its prisoners.** The cables describe the waterboarding of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the suspected mastermind behind the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole. CIA agents were trying to uncover plots against the U.S. in the wake of 9/11. As al-Nashiri cried and pleaded that he was trying to recall more information, the "water treatment was applied" in order to make him "suffer the consequences of his deception."

2. **Senior American national security officials tried to prevent Trump from upending a formal policy agreement between NATO allies last month by pushing the alliance's ambassadors to complete the joint communiqué before the forum began.** The plan work, to some degree, even though Trump questioned a major pillar of the defense alliance by questioning whether an attack on one NATO ally was an attack on them all.

3. **Michael Avenatti: "I’m exploring a run for the presidency of the United States."** Avenatti made the statement while in Iowa, where he said he wanted to "listen to people and learn about some issues that are facing the citizens of Iowa and do my homework."
