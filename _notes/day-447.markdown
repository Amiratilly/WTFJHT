1. **Trump told advisers in December that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller.** Trump was furious over reports that the subpoenas coming from Mueller's probe were targeting his business dealings with Deutsche Bank, which suggested that the investigation had expanded beyond the "red line" Trump set last year. Trump's lawyers and advisers later informed Trump that the reports about the probe were based on erroneous news reports.

3. **Michael Cohen said the FBI was "extremely professional, courteous and respectful" during the raids on his home, office, and hotel**. "I am unhappy to have my personal residence and office raided," Cohen said. "But I will tell you that members of the FBI that conducted the search and seizure were all extremely professional, courteous and respectful. And I thanked them at the conclusion."
