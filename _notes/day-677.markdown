1. **Robert Mueller said in a court filing that Paul Manafort violated his cooperation agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators**, relieving the special counsel's office of all the promises made to Manafort in his plea agreement. Defense attorneys for Manafort say the opposite is true, and that Manafort "believes he has provided truthful information." Both sides agreed that U.S. District Court Judge Amy Jackson should set a sentencing date as soon as possible. The apparent collapse of Manafort's plea deal means he could now face at least a decade in prison after pleading guilty in September to charges of tax fraud, violating foreign lobbying laws, and attempting to obstruct justice.
