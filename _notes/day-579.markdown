1. **Microsoft says it has identified attempts by a Russian hacking group to infiltrate U.S. candidates, campaigns and political groups.** Microsoft received permission from a federal court last week to take down malicious websites that mimicked the login pages of the Senate, the Microsoft Office 365 email platform, and two conservative think tanks. The Kremlin-linked hacking group Fancy Bear used the websites to try to trick targets into handing over their passwords. Microsoft says it has no evidence that the group was successful, but it remains "concerned that these latest attempts pose security threats to a broadening array of groups connected with both American political parties in the run-up to the 2018 elections."

2. **Trump said he is worried that any statements he makes to Robert Mueller under oath will be used to bring perjury charges against him.** "So if I say something and he (Comey) says something," Trump said in an interview, "and it’s my word against his, and he’s best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: ‘Well, I believe Comey,’ and even if I’m telling the truth, that makes me a liar. That’s no good." Trump refused to confirm or deny whether he would ultimately agree to an interview with Mueller. He also refused to say whether he would strip Mueller of his security clearance. "I haven’t given it a lot of thought," Trump said.
