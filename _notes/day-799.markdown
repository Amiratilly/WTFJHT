1. **Trump help a rally in Michigan in the wake of what he calls his "complete and total exoneration" by William Barr's summary of Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.** "After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead," Trump said in front of a roaring crowd. "The collusion delusion is over." Trump also used his time on stage to attack House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff, who has led the charge to investigate Trump's dealings with Russia and continues to insist that he has seen clear evidence of collusion. "Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff," Trump said. "He’s got the smallest, thinnest neck I’ve ever seen." Trump also called for retribution against "All of the Democrat politicians. The media bosses. Bad people. The crooked journalists," and everyone else who "paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics, they have to be — I’m sorry — they have to be accountable," Trump said. The crowd responded with chants of "Lock them up!"
