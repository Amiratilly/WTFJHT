1. **A third federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to shut down DACA**. U.S. District Court Judge John Bates said the government's argument for ending the program was too flimsy and unpersuasive. "DACAâ€™s rescission was arbitrary and capricious," Bates said, "because the Department \[of Homeland Security\] failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful." Bates continued: "Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program." Bates is the first Republican appointee to rule against the move to end DACA. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/24/third-judge-rules-against-trump-daca-550092))

2. **Ronny Jackson got drunk and banged on the hotel room of a female coworker in 2015 during a trip overseas**. The 2015 incident was so disruptive that the Secret Service had to step in and calm Jackson down so he wouldn't wake up President Obama. The incident is just one of many drunken incidents involving Jackson during overseas trips. Jackson is currently being considered as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
