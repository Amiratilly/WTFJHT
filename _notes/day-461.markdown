1. **A third federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to shut down DACA**. U.S. District Court Judge John Bates said the government's argument for ending the program was too flimsy and unpersuasive. "DACAâ€™s rescission was arbitrary and capricious," Bates said, "because the Department \[of Homeland Security\] failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful." Bates continued: "Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program."
