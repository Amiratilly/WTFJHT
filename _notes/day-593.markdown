1. **Trump kicked off Labor Day by attacking a top union leader.** Trump tweeted that AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka "represented his union poorly on television this weekend." Trump added: "It is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly. A Dem!" The attack came after Trumka appeared on Fox News and criticized Trump's attempts to overhaul NAFTA, claiming that the agreement should include Canada. "The things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers," Trumka said. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-attacks-union-leader-labor-day-57572623))
