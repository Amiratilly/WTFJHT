1. **Federal prosecutors admitted that they wrongly accused Maria Butina of offering to trade sex in order to infiltrate Republican circles on behalf of the Russian government.** Butina is a Russian citizen who is currently in custody and facing charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent. Prosecutors acknowledged in court filings that they were "mistaken" in their interpretation of what were apparently joke text messages between Butina and a friend.

2. **The Trump administration is expanding U.S. drone strikes in Africa.** The Obama administration curtailed the program toward the end of his term after a series of highly publicized civilian deaths as a result of the strikes. Now, the CIA is expanding its drone operations and moving aircraft to northeastern Niger in order to hunt and kill people in southern Libya.
