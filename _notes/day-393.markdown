1. **Top Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates is close to a plea deal with Robert Mueller.** Gates has been involved in plea negotiations for about a month, and sources familiar with the case say he is poised to cooperate with the investigation. If Gates agrees to a plea deal, he will be the third known cooperator in the special counsel's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

2. **The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 16-5 in favor of the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act**, despite protests from Jeff Sessions and some senators. The bill, along with its similar counterpart in the House, will likely face steep challenges with the rest of  the Legislature.

3. **Trump apparently engaged in another extramarital affair before he was elected, this time with former Playmate of the Year, Karen McDougal.** Trump also allegedly took elaborate steps to cover his tracks and prevent McDougal from speaking out about the alleged affair. The New Yorker obtained an eight-page, handwritten note from McDougal's friend, in which McDougal details her relationship with Trump.
