1. **Senate Republicans are pushing for a short impeachment trial that would include calling zero witnesses**. The plan contradicts Trump's calls to stage a more theatrical trial and public defense of his conduct by calling multiple witnesses, including Joe and Hunter Biden.

2. **The White House Office of Management and Budget claims in a new memo that it withheld U.S. military aid to Ukraine as a temporary exploratory measure** â€“ not as part of a political effort to override Congress' appropriation of the money. The OMB memo asserts that the office withheld the aid as a way of studying whether the spending complied with U.S. policy. The new memo says OMB extended the hold on the aid eight times in August and September until finally releasing the aid almost immediately after the last hold on September 10.
