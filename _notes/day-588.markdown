1. **George Papadopoulos decided to accept a plea deal from Robert Mueller and plead guilty to lying to the FBI.** He admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had "substantial connections to Russian government officials." Padadopoulos was strongly considering backing away from the deal earlier this month, but decided to accept the deal and cooperate with Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
