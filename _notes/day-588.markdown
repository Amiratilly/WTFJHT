1. **The Trump administration has been denying passports to U.S. citizens and accusing hundreds of Latinos along the southern border of using fake birth certificates to obtain citizenship.** The State Department said it "has not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport applications," but news reports suggest a dramatic shift in both immigration enforcement and the way passports are issued. Some passport applicants with U.S. birth certificates are being imprisoned at immigration detention centers and entered into deportation proceedings, while others have had their passports revoked when trying to reenter the United States.

2. **George Papadopoulos decided to accept a plea deal from Robert Mueller and plead guilty to lying to the FBI.** He admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had "substantial connections to Russian government officials." Padadopoulos was strongly considering backing away from the deal earlier this month, but decided to accept the deal and cooperate with Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
