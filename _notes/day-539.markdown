1. **NATO officials said Trump threatened to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if other countries don't increase their security contributions.** Trump then claimed that NATO allies had agreed to unprecedented increases in defense contributions beyond 2 percent of their GDP, and said that pulling out of the alliance would now be "unnecessary." French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump "never at any moment, either in public or in private, threatened to withdraw from NATO," and denied that NATO allies had agreed to boost defense spending beyond the 2 percent mark.

2. **The Trump administration is implementing a new policy at the border that will result in thousands of asylum seekers being turned away before they have an opportunity to plead their case for asylum in court.** The new guidance also applies to refugees. Under the new policy, claims based on fears of gang and domestic violence will be rejected out of hand. Officers are also being told to consider whether an immigrant or asylum seeker crossed the border illegally and take that into consideration when weighing each claim.

3. **Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh racked up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt from buying baseball tickets over the last decade.** At times, his reported liabilities may have even exceeded the value of his cash and investment accounts. White House spokesperson Raj Shah said Kavanaugh built up the debt by buying Washington Nationals tickets for himself and friends, and that some of his debts were for home improvement projects. Kavanaugh's debts reached between $60,000 and $200,000 in 2016, but the loans were either paid off or fell below the reporting requirements by the following year.

4. **Robert Mueller has asked a federal court in Virginia for 100 blank subpoenas in the case against Paul Manafort.** The subpoenas would require the recipients to testify in federal court on July 25, the day Manafort's trial is set to begin. Mueller recently asked for 150 blank subpoenas about a month ago. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/396597-mueller-asks-court-for-100-more-blank-subpoenas-ahead-of-manafort))
