1. **The House of Representatives passed a stopgap measure to fund the government that includes $5 billion in border wall funding.** The bill passed 217 to 185 but is expected to be rejected in the Senate. The measure does nothing to prevent a potential government shutdown. The vote puts the House at odds with the Senate, which passed its own funding bill on Wednesday that does not include money for the wall. The Senate will have to consider the House version before midnight tonight in order to avoid a partial government shutdown. Mitch McConnell has suggested that members should be ready for a vote later tonight.

2. **The Trump administration has ordered the Pentagon to draft plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan.** The plans are due early next year, and must include multiple options for withdrawal. No decision has been made yet, Trump just wants to see options. The U.S. currently has 14,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan and has been occupying the country for 17 years â€” the longest war in U.S. history.
