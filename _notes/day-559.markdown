1. **Robert Mueller has referred three investigations into possible illicit foreign lobbying to New York prosecutors who are already handling the case against Michael Cohen.** All three cases are linked to Paul Manafort, who brought other Washington lobbyists and lawyers into his work on behalf of Ukrainian politicians. The cases are examining whether those lobbyists also failed to register as foreign agents and how they were paid. None of the three men have been charged with a crime, but Mueller's team has subpoenaed or requested documents from all three of their firms.

2. **China promised to retaliate against the United States if Trump imposes an additional 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.** The tariffs would target thousands of Chinese imports, and raising the proposed tariffs from 10 to 25 percent would escalate the already heated trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. "Unilateral threats and pressure will only produce the opposite of the desired result," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

3. **Trump is considering another sharp reduction in the number of refugees admitted into the United States.** One plan under consideration calls for no more than 25,000 refugees resettlements next year, a cut of more than 40 percent from this year's limit. It would be the lowest number of refugees admitted to the country since the start of the program in 1980.

4. **A scammer tried to get inside information about U.S. sanctions on Russia by calling a U.S. senator and pretending to represent a Latvian official.** Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was contacted through her staff by someone who called himself Arturs Vaiders and claimed to be working for the Latvian foreign ministry in order to discuss the "prolongation of anti-Russian sanctions" and "general security with Kaspersky laboratory case." Shaheen contacted the Latvian government to confirm the caller's credentials, but the embassy responded that the outreach attempt was fake.

5. **Trump has made 4,229 false or misleading statements in the first 558 days of his administration â€” an average of 7.6 claims per day.** In the last two months alone, Trump added 978 claims to the tally. During his first 100 days, Trump clocked in at an average of 4.9 claims per day. Trump's high score for daily lies and falsehoods was July 5, and June and July 2018 were his first- and second-highest months, respectively.
