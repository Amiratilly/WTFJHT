1. **Mike Pompeo admitted that he was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky** when Trump asked Zelensky to have Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son. "I was on the phone call," Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister, hours before the State Department's inspector general's "urgent" private briefing he requested with senior congressional staff members about documents related to the Ukraine scandal. Pompeo's admission was the first time he confirmed that he was on the call â€” after previously evading questions about what he knew about the conversation and news reports that revealed he was on the call.

2. **Trump has repeatedly talked about fortifying his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators**, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He also wanted the wall to be electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. On another occasion, after he publicly suggested that soldiers should shoot migrants if they threw rocks, Trump backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But at a later meeting, Trump suggested that border patrol could shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. Aides had to remind him that shooting migrants in the legs was also illegal.
