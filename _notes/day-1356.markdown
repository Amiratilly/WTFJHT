1. **Trump returned to the White House after leaving Walter Reed medical center.** Upon his arrival, Trump stood outside and removed his mask, despite the fact that he is still infected and contagious. He flashed a double thumbs up and posed for photos before walking inside as his helicopter departed. Shortly after, he released a video produced by his aides, in which he claimed that he "had to" face the coronavirus because he is a leader. "We're going back. We're going back to work. We're gonna be out front. As your leader I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it but I had to do it," Trump said. "I stood out front. I led. Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. I know there's a risk there's a danger." He added: "And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune? I don't know." Trump then encouraged Americans to "get out there" and to not let the virus "dominate your lives."

2. **The White House is not conducting contact tracing for guests and staff members who attended the Rose Garden party** where at least eight people, including Trump, are believed to have contracted COVID-19. Officials with the D.C. Department of Health have been unable to connect with the White House to assist with contact tracing and other protocols regarding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Instead, the White House has only been notifying people who came in close contact with Trump during the two days before his diagnosis on Thursday. "We have reached out to the White House on a couple of different levels, a political level and a public health level," said Mayor Muriel Bowser. White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement that that White House "has a robust contact tracing program in place led by the White House Medical Unit with CDC personnel and guidance."
