1. **Trump returned to the White House after leaving Walter Reed medical center.** Upon his arrival, Trump stood outside and removed his mask, despite the fact that he is still infected and contagious. He flashed a double thumbs up and posed for photos before walking inside as his helicopter departed. Shortly after, he released a video produced by his aides, in which he claimed that he "had to" face the coronavirus because he is a leader. "We're going back. We're going back to work. We're gonna be out front. As your leader I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it but I had to do it," Trump said. "I stood out front. I led. Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did. I know there's a risk there's a danger." He added: "And now I'm better, and maybe I'm immune? I don't know." Trump then encouraged Americans to "get out there" and to not let the virus "dominate your lives."
