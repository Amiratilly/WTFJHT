1. **Rudy Giuliani was part of a back-channel effort by the U.S. to remove Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro from power**. Giuliani and then-Rep. Pete Sessions were on the phone with Maduro in Sept. 2018 following a visit by Sessions to Caracas that spring. People familiar with the effort say it was "part of a shadow diplomatic effort, backed in part by private interests, aimed at engineering a negotiated exit to ease President Nicolás Maduro from power and reopen resource-rich Venezuela to business." The phone call between Giuliani and Maduro has not be previously reported, and it provides another example of Trump's personal attorney inserting himself into U.S. foreign policy without specifying whose interests he was representing.
