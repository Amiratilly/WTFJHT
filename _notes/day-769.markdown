2. **Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has agreed to return to Congress and meet with lawmakers behind closed doors to "clarify" parts of his previous public testimony**, during which he claimed he never made "any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation" to Trump. The House Judiciary Committee, however, believes it has evidence that Trump asked Whitaker while he was acting AG whether he could install a Trump ally to oversee the investigation into Michael Cohen.
