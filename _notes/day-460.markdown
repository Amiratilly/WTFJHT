1. **Sean Hannity's real estate venture bought properties through a dealer who was involved in a criminal conspiracy to fraudulently buy foreclosed homes**. Jeff Brock pleaded guilty in 2016 to federal charges of bank fraud and conspiracy for rigging foreclosure auctions between 2007 and 2012. Brock purchased 11 homes in Georgia following foreclosures and sold them to Hannity's shell company in 2012. There is no evidence that Hannity was aware of Brock's involvement in fraud.
