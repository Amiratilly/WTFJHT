1. **The Trump administration ordered the U.S. ambassador to the European Union not to appear before House lawmakers for a planned deposition** as part of the impeachment inquiry. Lawmakers want information about Ambassador Gordon Sondland's activities related to Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son. Sondland said he was willing and happy to testify, but he did not appear as scheduled this morning after he was ordered not to by the State Department. Sondland's attorney said that as a State Department employee, Sondland had no choice but to comply with the order. House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff called the White Houseâ€™s move to block Sondland from testifying "further acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government."
