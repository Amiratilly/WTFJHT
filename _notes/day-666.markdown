2. **Prosecutors inadvertently revealed secret criminal charges filed against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange** in the U.S. by accidentally mentioning the charges in [an unrelated court filing](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/179/399086/18919235200.pdf). "The court filing was made in error," said a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Virginia. "That was not the intended name for this filing." The charges against Assange center around the publication of emails from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.
