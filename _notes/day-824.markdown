1. **The White House instructed a former official in charge of the security clearance process to refuse to comply with a subpoena from the House of Representatives.** Democrats subpoenaed Carl Kline for an interview, but Trump's deputy counsel argued in a letter that the subpoena "unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests." Kline's attorney said Kline, who now works for the Department of Defense, is being forced to choose between "two masters from two equal branches of government," and that Kline intends to "follow the instructions of the one that employs him." Kline worked for two years as Trump's personnel security director, during which time at least 25 people received security clearances despite serious concerns raised during the vetting process. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings says Kline will be held in contempt if he doesn't comply with the subpoena.
