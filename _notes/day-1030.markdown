1. **The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine will testify publicly today as part of the House impeachment inquiry**. Marie Yovanovitch is expected to tell House investigators about how she became the target of a smear campaign by Rudy Giuliani which eventually led to her ouster from the State Department. Yovanovitch had already been removed from her post by the time Trump had his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but she was able to witness the early stages of Trump and Giuliani's efforts to influence Ukrainian policy and pressure Zelensky to investigate Trump's political rivals.
