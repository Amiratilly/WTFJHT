1. **North and South Korea agreed to end their seven-decade war**. The two neighboring countries signed an agreement to end the war during an historic meeting between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in. The deal also includes promises from both leaders to pursue "complete denuclearization" of the Korean Penninsula. Trump hailed the peace effort on Twitter, saying "KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!"

2. **Longtime NBC News correspondent Linda Vester accused Tom Brokaw of sexually harassing her in the 1990s**. Vester tried to kiss her on two separate occasions, groped her in an NBC conference room, and once came to her hotel room uninvited. Vester's contemporaneous journal entries and two of her friends have corroborated her allegations. Brokaw denied the allegations. "I met with Linda Vester on two occasions," he said, "both at her request, 23 years ago because she wanted advice with respect to her career at NBC." Brokaw continued: "The meetings were brief, cordial and appropriate, and despite Lindaâ€™s allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her at that time or any other."
