1. **Trump threatened military action in response to an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend**. Trump said the U.S. is "locked and loaded" but he is waiting to consult with Saudi officials before taking any action. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack. Trump administration officials are blaming Iran. Defense Secretary Mike Pompeo called the incident "an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply," and insisted that there was "no evidence the attacks came from Yemen." This morning, Trump said "We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas," but said the U.S. "will help our allies!"
