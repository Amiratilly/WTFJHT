1. **Trump threatened military action in response to an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend**. Trump said the U.S. is "locked and loaded" but he is waiting to consult with Saudi officials before taking any action. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack. Trump administration officials are blaming Iran. Defense Secretary Mike Pompeo called the incident "an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply," and insisted that there was "no evidence the attacks came from Yemen." This morning, Trump said "We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas," but said the U.S. "will help our allies!"

2. **The acting director of national intelligence is withholding a whistleblower complaint alleging serious wrongdoing in the intelligence community that may involve Trump**, according to a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee. Joseph Maguire consulted the Justice Department about the whistleblower complaint prior to his decision to withhold the complaint, a major departure from standard practice. Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said the Committee "can only conclude, based on this remarkable confluence of factors, that the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or Administration officials."

3. **Several Democratic presidential candidates called for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to be impeached after new information about the allegations of sexual misconduct against him became public**. The Senate investigation into the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, a former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, concluded that Ramirez's allegations lacked corroboration. But at least seven people "heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge," including Ramirez's mother and two of her classmates who learned about it just days after the alleged incident occurred. Reporters also uncovered a second, previously unreported incident involving Kavanaugh.
