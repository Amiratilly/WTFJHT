1. **Former White House chief of staff John Kelly said Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals was "tantamount to an illegal order,"** and that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was right to report Trump's July 25 call with Volodymyr Zelensky. "He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave," Kelly said during an event. "He went and told his boss what he just heard." Kelly said Trump's decision to make aid to Ukraine contingent upon Zelensky announcing investigations into his political rivals "essentially changed" U.S. policy toward Ukraine.
