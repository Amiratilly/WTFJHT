1. **Trump's allies are calling for a compromise when it comes to the president's interview with Mueller.** They don't want Trump to sit down and speak freely with Mueller, but they also want to avoid a standoff that could make its way to the Supreme Court if neither side balks. Trump's legal team is still exploring the possibility of a written exchange with Mueller. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/07/trump-mueller-russia-probe-395958))

2. **Trump still wants to talk to Mueller despite the concerns of his associates, partly because he believes he is completely innocent.** Trump apparently also believes that his experience with lawsuits and testifying under oath during his time as a real estate mogul will allow him to get through his interview with Mueller unscathed.

3. **Democrats flipped a Missouri state House of Representatives seat that went for Trump by a 61-33 margin in 2016.** Mike Revis, a 27-year-old Democrat, managed to beat out Republic David Linton by 108 votes, or about 3 percent of the vote.
