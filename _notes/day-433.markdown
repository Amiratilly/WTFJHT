5. **Mueller's office is asking for jail time for Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to special prosecutors and the FBI**.

Earlier court filings show he faces up to six months behind bars. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/robert-mueller-van-der-zwaan?utm_term=.btl1D9QMNQ#.qnBJjQ2032))
