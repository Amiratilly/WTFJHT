1. **Dr. Deborah Birx said many of the social distancing guidelines currently in place will have to be extended through the summer.** Although recent trends have given her "great hope" for a slow reopening over the next few months, Birx said "we have to realize that we have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing" in order to get a more accurate picture of how the coronavirus spreads before we can relax social distancing restrictions. She added that her task force plans to continue working with states to scale up testing, and will be specifically working toward advancements in antigen testing so they can know whether someone has already had the virus and allow them to "screen large numbers of individuals quickly." Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. should at least double coronavirus testing efforts in the coming weeks before starting to reopen the economy. The U.S. currently goes through anywhere between 1.5 million and 2 million tests per week, but Fauci says "we should probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks." He added: "And I think we will."
