1. **Trump had Jeff Sessions fire Andrew McCabe, the now-former deputy director of the FBI, just days before he was set to retire.** Sessions announced the decision to fire McCabe just before 10 pm ET on Friday. Sessions said he fired McCabe because "Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions." In an interview, McCabe defended himself. “The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong,” he said. McCabe added: “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.”([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-fired.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbis-andrew-mccabe-is-fired-a-little-more-than-24-hours-before-he-could-retire/2018/03/16/e055a22a-2895-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html?utm_term=.d5c294fe718e))
