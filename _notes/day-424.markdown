1. **Trump had Jeff Sessions fire Andrew McCabe, the now-former deputy director of the FBI, just days before he was set to retire.** Sessions announced the decision to fire McCabe just before 10 pm ET on Friday. Sessions said he fired McCabe because "Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions." In an interview, McCabe defended himself. “The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong,” he said. McCabe added: “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.”([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-fired.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbis-andrew-mccabe-is-fired-a-little-more-than-24-hours-before-he-could-retire/2018/03/16/e055a22a-2895-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html?utm_term=.d5c294fe718e))

2. **McCabe met with special counsel Robert Mueller and turned over memos he wrote that detail his interactions with Trump.** The memos apparently include corroborating details about the firing of former FBI director James Comey. In response, Trump fired off a series of tweets, railing against Mueller's investigation and calling McCabe's memo's fake. "Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me." Trump tweeted. "I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?"

3. **Trump's lawyer John Dowd, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he hopes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein shuts down Robert Mueller's investigation** into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. "I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd wrote.

4. **An investigation by the New York Times and the The Observer of London reveals how the data firm Cambridge Analytica exploited the Facebook data of more than 50 million Americans without their permission.** The firm harvested personal data from Facebook profiles, allowing them to develop the techniques they used to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election.
