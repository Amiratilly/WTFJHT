1. **Jared and Ivanka wield an inordinate amount of influence over who gets selected to be Trump's next chief of staff.** Prospective appointees must win the approval of Trump's daughter and son-in-law in order to have any hope of getting the job, which could hurt the chances of some hopefuls. Trump has essentially been "just calling around to friends" to find people to fill the position, but Jared and Ivanka have their sights set on Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, who they see as extremely loyal. Mnuchin, however, remains uninterested in the position. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/12/trump-white-house-chief-of-staff-search-ivanka-jared-1059163))

2. **Jared and Ivanka are poised to benefit financially from the Opportunity Zone tax break they pushed Trump to pass.** Opportunity Zones provide massive tax breaks to developers who invest in depressed American communities. Watchdog investigators say the pair are navigating an ethical minefield after becoming two of Trump's closest advisers without divesting from their vast real estate investments. The couple owns stakes in at least 13 properties held by Kushner's family firm that could now qualify for tax breaks because they are in Opportunity Zones in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland.

3. **Trump reiterated his decision to stand by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite his own CIA's assessment that MBS ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.** "He’s the leader of Saudi Arabia," Trump said during an interview. "They’ve been a very good ally." Trump continued to defend MBS by reiterating that the "crown prince vehemently denies" any involvement in Khashoggi's death.
