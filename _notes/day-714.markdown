1. **Trump told a group of lawmakers at a meeting on border security that he can't accept the offer from Democrats to re-open the government because "I would look foolish if I did that,"** according to an anonymous source. Trump and the Democrats remain at an impasse over funding for Trump's border wall, and Nancy Pelosi has remained firm on her refusal to accommodate Trump's demands. "We can go through the back and forth," Pelosi said. "No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall." Sen. Lindsay Graham, meanwhile, has been pressuring Trump to hold firm as well. "If he gives in now, that’s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president," Graham said. "That’s the probably the end of his presidency."
