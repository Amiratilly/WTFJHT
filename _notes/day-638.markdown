1. **Trump praised Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter.** Gianforte pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor assault charges related to the incident. "Any guy that can do a body slam — he's my kind of guy," Trump said to during a rally in Missoula. "He's a great guy, tough cookie." Trump's comments were met with cheers and laughter from the crowd.

2. **Trump said he believes Jamal Khashoggi is dead and expressed confidence in the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that suggest a high-level Saudi role in Khashoggi's death.** Trump stopped short of blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for ordering Khashoggi's assassination. "Unless the miracle of all miracles happens, I would acknowledge that he's dead," Trump told reporters. "That’s based on everything — intelligence coming from every side." When asked about the potential punishment if Saudi Arabia is found to be culpable for the killing, Trump said, "Well, it'll have to be very severe. I mean, it’s bad, bad stuff."
