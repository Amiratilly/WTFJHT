1. **A landmark scientific report issued by 13 federal agencies includes the most drastic and specific warnings to date of the consequences of climate change for the United States.** Among other things, [the report](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) predicts that the effects of global warming will eliminate as much as 10%  of the U.S. economy by the end of the century. The report's findings and calculations are blunt and precise. They're also directly at odds with the Trump administration's environmental deregulation agenda, which Trump claims will lead to economic growth. The report's predictions include devastating effects on the U.S. economy, health, and environment, including record wildfires in California, widespread Midwestern crop failures, and crumbling infrastructure in the South. The report adds to the conclusions of an earlier iteration, which also warned of increasing water scarcity in dry areas, torrential downpours in wet regions, and increasingly severe heat waves and wildfires throughout.
