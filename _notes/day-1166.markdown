1. **Trump extended federal social distancing guidelines until at least April 30**. The extension is a reversal from last week, when Trump said he planned to relax coronavirus restrictions by Easter weekend. Trump said all Americans must continue to stay home when possible and avoid gatherings of 10 or more people for at least another month and possibly until June. "By June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery," Trump said. "We think by June 1, a lot of great things will be happening." Trump claimed his earlier predictions of an April 12 "reopening" of the country was simply "aspirational" and was not intended as an actual timeline. Dr. Anthony Fauci called the extension of social distancing guidelines a "wise and prudent decision." On Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of Americans could still die as a result of the coronavirus, even "if we do things almost perfectly" and take aggressive action to slow the spread.
