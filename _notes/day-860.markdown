1. **Mitch McConnell says he would work to confirm a new Supreme Court justice if a vacancy occurs during next year's presidential election.** In contrast, McConnell refused to confirm Obama's nominee after the death of Antonin Scalia during the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. McConnell claimed that voters had a right to decide whether a Democrat or Republican should fill the open seat on the Court. When asked what his position would be when it came to filling a potentially vacant seat next year, however, McConnell smiled and said, "Oh, we'd fill it."

2. **The vast majority of money from Trump's bailout for farmers is likely to go to the largest farms, not the small mom-and-pop farms**. Farms with annual revenues of several million dollars are likely to see the most bailout money. Most are major beneficiaries of federal crop support programs that handle billions of dollars in subsidies and low-cost crop insurance. Findings from the Environmental Working Group suggest that "the biggest payments will go to the wealthiest farmers, who need them the least."

3. **It's been a year since the Pentagon has held an on-camera press briefing with any department spokesperson.** "Weâ€™re talking about some sort of strike on another country and nobody knows why," said one Pentagon reporter. A spokesperson for the Defense Department pushed back against the claim, saying, "It depends what your definition of a briefing is."
