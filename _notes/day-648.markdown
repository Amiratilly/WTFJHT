1. **A group of progressive Jewish leaders told Trump that he's not welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism.** The comments came in the wake of the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead and many more injured over the weekend. "Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted," the group wrote in a letter to Trump. "You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterdayâ€™s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country."
