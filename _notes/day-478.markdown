1. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after four women accused him of physically assaulting them. Schneiderman positioned himself as a public champion of women's rights and an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement, but four women have come forward to allege that he subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. The women claim that he frequently hit them after drinking, often in bed and never with their consent. Two of the women say Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. Schneiderman resigned three hours after the allegations were made public.
