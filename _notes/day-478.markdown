1. **New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after four women accused him of physically assaulting them**. Schneiderman positioned himself as a public champion of women's rights and an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement, but four women have come forward alleging that he subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. The women claim that he frequently hit them after drinking, often in bed and never with their consent. Two of the women say Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. Schneiderman resigned three hours after the allegations were made public.

2. **Robert Mueller rejected Trump's request to allow him to answer questions from investigators in writing**. Trump's legal team has been pushing for Mueller to allow him to submit written answers to Mueller's questions, because they're afraid that Trump might lie to or mislead investigators during an in-person interview. Rudy Giuliani has said that Trump will fight a potential subpoena for him to testify in front of a grand jury, but has stopped short of saying that Trump would go as far as to ignore a subpoena from the special counsel.
