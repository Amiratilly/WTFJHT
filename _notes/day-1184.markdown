Cohen will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine in prison before he is released. 14 inmates and seven staff members have tested positive for the virus at the New York State facility where Cohen is currently incarcerated.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson's dismissal of Stone's retrial request means Stone could begin serving his 40-month prison sentence as soon as two weeks from now.
