1. **Trump signed a proclamation yesterday to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, but the order likely won't allow them to have physical contact with immigrants**. This isn't the first time the White House has sent troops to support U.S. Border Patrol agents â€“ Presidents Obama and George W. Bush took similar actions. The exact number of troops and the length of their deployment is still unknown, but more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.

2. **The White House is reportedly considering a proposal that could strip protections from hundreds of threatened species**. The proposal is called "Removal of Blanket Section 4(d) Rule." Removing the blanket rule, which is used by the Fish and Wildlife Service to protect animals and plants that are at risk of becoming endangered, could give oil and agriculture companies more freedom to use land that was previously off-limits due to the presence of certain protected species.
