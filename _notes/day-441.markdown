1. **Trump signed a proclamation yesterday to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, but the order likely won't allow them to have physical contact with immigrants**. This isn't the first time the White House has sent troops to support U.S. Border Patrol agents â€“ Presidents Obama and George W. Bush took similar actions. The exact number of troops and the length of their deployment is still unknown, but more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.
