1. **Three members of the White House coronavirus task force will self-quarantine after possibly being exposed to COVID-19**. Dr. Anthony Fauci has begun a "modified quarantine" after he had "low risk" contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week for coronavirus. The "low risk" label means Fauci wasn't in close proximity to the aide during the time when they were known to be positive for the virus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control, will self-quarantine for 14 days. And FDA chief Stephen Hahn has been in self-quarantine since Friday. Fauci tested negative for COVID-19, according to a spokesperson, and he is "actively monitoring his temperature and other health indicators." Fauci and Redfield are scheduled to testify remotely on Tuesday before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
