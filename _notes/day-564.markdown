1. **Trump admitted that the purpose of the Trump Tower meeting in 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer was to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.** "Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower," Trump tweeted. "This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!" Trump's tweet is in direct conflict with Don Jr.'s statement about the meeting, which was dictated by Trump himself. Don Jr.'s original statement claimed that the primary reason for the meeting was to discuss the adoption of Russian children.

2. **Two of the largest American steel companies, both of which have deep ties to the Trump administration, successfully objected to hundreds of tariff exemption requests by American companies that buy foreign steel.** Nucor and United States Steel objected to 1,600 exemption requests filed with the Commerce Department over the last several months, arguing that companies should not be exempt from the tariffs because the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers. The Trump administration established a process for companies to request "exclusions" from the metal tariffs, but the Commerce Department also allowed American companies to challenge exclusion requests. Not a single exclusion challenge by the two companies has failed to date. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/nucor-us-steel-tariff-exemptions.html))
