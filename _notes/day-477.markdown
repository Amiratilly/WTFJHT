1. **Michael Cohen's $600,000 deal with AT&T included providing advice to the telecom giant about the company's proposed merger with Time Warner**. Trump had voiced opposition to the $85 billion merger on the campaign trail, and his administration ultimately opposed the deal. While he was being paid to advise AT&T, Cohen was also being paid to advise other companies on a wide range of issues.
