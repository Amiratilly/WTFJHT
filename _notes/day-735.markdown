1. **Mitch McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.** He also blocked a bill on Tuesday that would have funded the Department of Homeland Security until Feb. 8. The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on two bills that would completely reopen the government; one comes with three years of TPS and DACA protections and $5.7 billion for Trump's wall, while the other is just a continuing resolution that would last until Feb. 8.
