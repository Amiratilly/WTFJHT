1. **Trump told James Mattis to submit a $750 billion defense budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year.** Trump previously called for a reduction in defense spending, but now he appears to have reversed course. Mattis and other top military leaders have been fighting to preserve the current $733 billion proposal, and Trump has called for a top line of $716 billion and even $700 billion as recently as October.

2. **Nick Ayers declined Trump's offer to take over for John Kelly as his chief of staff.** Ayers currently serves as Mike Pence's chief of staff, and said that he is instead leaving the administration entirely at the end of the year to spend more time with his family in Georgia. Trump didn't appear to have an obvious second choice lined up, but some believe he is eyeing North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows, who serves as the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.
