1. **Counterintelligence officials are investigating the negotiations and financing surrounding one of Ivanka Trump's international business deals involving the Trump Hotel and Tower in Vancouver.** It's not clear why investigators are looking into this particular deal, but CNN says the timing of the deal could be of interest. The 616-foot tower opened in February 2017, just after Trump took office, and the Trump Organization reportedly took in more than $5 million in royalties and $21,500 in management fees from the Vancouver property.
