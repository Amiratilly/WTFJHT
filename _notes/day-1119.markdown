1. **National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien says he was the one who removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his brother Yevgeny from the National Security Council, not Trump.** "Those were my decisions and I stand by them," he said. O'Brien also claimed that Vindman and his brother weren't fired, they were simply rotated out of the White House ahead of schedule. "It was just time for them to go back," O'Brien added, "their service was no longer needed." Trump, however, admitted the day after Vindman's ouster that Vindman was removed because he was "insubordinate" and "reported the contents of my 'perfect' phone calls incorrectly."
