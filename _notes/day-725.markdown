1. **The FBI opened an investigation days after Trump fired Comey to determine whether Trump had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia.** Law enforcement officials became so concerned with Trump's behavior that they began investigating whether Trump's own actions constituted a threat to national security. Investigators also worked to determine whether Trump was purposefully working for Moscow or had unwittingly fallen prey to Russia's influence.
