1. **The former Infowars Washington bureau chief says he expects to be charged by the special counsel within a matter of days.** Jeromi Corsi says he doesn't know what they will charge him with, but the special counsel has indicated that he will be charged with something. "I think my only crime was that I support Donald Trump," Corsi added. "That's my crime, and now I'm going to go to prison for the rest of my life for cooperating with them." Corsi is one of more than a dozen people associated with Roger Stone who have been in contact with the special counsel. Corsi described his interactions with the special counsel as "an inquisition worthy of the KGB or the Gestapo. I feel like I've been through an interrogation session in North Korea in the Korean war."
