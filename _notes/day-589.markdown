1. **Trump says Jeff Sessions will remain as the attorney general at least until after the midterms**, even as he continued to criticize Sessions for failing to stop Mueller's "illegal investigation." "I just would love to have him do a great job," Trump said Thursday. "I’d love to have him look at the other side." Trump also claimed that "great scholars" have said that "there never should have been a special counsel."

2. **Trump's disapproval ratings are at an all-time high of 60 percent.** That includes 53 percent who disapprove strongly, with only 36 percent approving — matching his all-time low. Trump's average approval rating is lower than any president since the 1940s. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trouble-trump-disapproval-high-63-back-mueller-half/story?id=57507081))
