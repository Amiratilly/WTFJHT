1. **James Comey sat down for an interview with ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopolous** to discuss his encounters with Trump and his forthcoming book "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership." During the interview, Comey discussed Trump's behavior in office and said he was "morally unfit to be president." Comey also likened Trump to an unethical mob boss, among other things.

2. **Trump attacked Comey on Twitter and suggested that the former FBI director deserves to be imprisoned.** Trump's tweets were replete with unproven assertions and claims about Comey's memos from his encounters with Trump, allegations that Comey leaked classified information, and his interactions with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
