1. **The full House will convene to openly debate and vote on two articles of impeachment against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress**. After an hour of debate over the "rule" governing the proceedings, lawmakers from both parties will spend six hours debating the actual articles of impeachment and whether to approve or reject them. The time will be split evenly between both parties, but Republicans could introduce procedural obstacles that would stretch the proceedings later into the evening.

1. **Adam Schiff accused Mike Pence of refusing to declassify testimony that is "directly relevant" to the impeachment debate**. Schiff sent a letter to Pence arguing that classified witness testimony from Jennifer Williams, Pence’s Russia adviser, "raises profound questions about your knowledge of the President’s scheme to solicit Ukraine’s interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election." Williams' testimony was provided to the Intelligence Committee on Nov. 26 and Schiff asked Pence to declassify it ten days later, but Pence's office refused.
