1. **Ivanka Trump told NBC that her father's proposal to arm teachers is an option that needs to be discussed.** "I think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea," Trump said in an interview. "But it is an idea that needs to be discussed." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/ivanka-trump-arming-teachers-option-needs-be-discussed-n850801))

2. **Trump's reelection campaign used [a photo](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180225135708-trump-pence-weekly-newsletter-photo-parkland-survivor-madeleine-wilford-exlarge-169.jpg) of one of the survivors of the Parkland, FL shooting in an email asking for campaign donations.** The photo shows 17-year-old Madeline Wilford in a hospital bed, surrounded by members of her family.

3. **The House Intelligence Committee released a redacted version of the Democratic memo rebutting the memo written by Devin Nunez**, which claimed to show bias and abuses of power by the FBI and Justice Department against the Trump campaign. Trump blocked the release of the latest memo two weeks ago, but it was released anyway after undergoing days of review by top law enforcement officials.
