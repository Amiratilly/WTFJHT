1. **A New York appellate court judge ruled that Simon & Schuster can go forward with the publication of Mary Trump's tell-all book about her uncle, Donald Trump.** The decision from Judge Alan D. Scheinkman reverses a lower court decision that temporarily halted publication of the book, "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the Worldâ€™s Most Dangerous Man," which is scheduled for release at the end of July. In his decision, Judge Scheinkman declined to address the central claim from the Trump administration: that Mary Trump violated a 20-year-old non-disclosure agreement by writing the book. Instead, the judge ruled that Simon & Schuster was not a party to the agreement and therefore could not be bound by it.
