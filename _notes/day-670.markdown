1. **Ivanka Trump repeatedly used a private email account to conduct government business in 2017.** A White House review found her personal email use included exchanges with cabinet secretaries and forwards of her schedule to her assistant. Ivanka told people in the White House that she didn't know the rules about her use of a personal email account.

2. **A federal judge barred the Trump administration from refusing to provide asylum to immigrants who cross the U.S. border illegally.** U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar rejected Trump's Nov. 9 proclamation that said anyone who failed to cross into the U.S. at a designated port of entry would not be granted asylum. "Whatever the scope of the Presidentâ€™s authority," Judge Tigar wrote, "he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden." The ruling will remain in effect for one month barring any further appeals.
