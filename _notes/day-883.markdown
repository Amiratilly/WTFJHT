1. **Trump authorized military strikes against Iran but called off the attack at the last minute**. Trump initially approved attacks against a handful of Iranian targets, including radar and missile batteries. Planes were already in the air and ships were in position when the order came to stand down. The attack would have been Trump's third military strike against targets in the Middle East. The strike was meant to be a response to Iran's downing of an American surveillance drone. Iran says the drone violated Iranian airspace, while the U.S. says the drone was shot down in international airspace.

2. **Iran received a message from Trump via Oman warning that an attack on Iran was imminent**. Iranian officials said Trump claimed he was "against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues." They also said Trump "gave a short period of time to get our response but Iranâ€™s immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader." Another official said they would deliver Trump's message to the Ayatollah, "however, we told the Omani official that any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences."

3. **A legal team interviewed 60 children at a migrant detention facility near El Paso, TX and were told stories of neglect and mistreatment at the hands of the U.S. government**.

4. **ICE has deported more immigrants during the first eight months of this fiscal year than any full fiscal year of Trump's presidency**, but he has yet to match Obama's early deportation numbers. ICE deportations fell to 226,119 in fiscal 2017, they rose to more than 250,000 in fiscal 2018 and hit a Trump administration high of 282,242 as of June this fiscal year.
