1. **More than 200 Russian mercenaries were killed in a clash with U.S. forces in Syria last week.** The fighters attacked a base and refinery held by the U.S. and were defeated. It is not clear whether the attack was a rouge operation or if it was ordered by Russia. Defense Secretary Mattis called the situation "perplexing."
