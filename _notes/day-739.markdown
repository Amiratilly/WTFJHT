1. **The Trump administration lifted sanctions against three companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.** The Treasury Department originally sanctioned Deripaska, six other oligarchs and their companies in April in response to Russia's "malign activity" around the world. The sanctions against Deripaska himself will remain in effect, but his companies launched a lobbying campaign to argue that the sanctions against aluminum giant Rusal would disrupt the aluminum market and damage U.S. companies. The Russian stock index shot up to an all-time high and shares in Rusal hit their highest since April on Monday in response to the decision. Aluminum prices in the U.S. fell by as much as 1.4 percent after the open.
