1. **The Justice Department briefed White House lawyers about the conclusions made in Robert Mueller's report multiple times in recent days**, which has helped Trump’s legal team prepare a strategy for responding to the report’s findings. Attorney General William Barr held a news conference that started at 9:30 a.m. ET to discuss the report, and the Justice Department will deliver the report to Congress around 11 a.m. ET. The report will also be posted later to the special counsel’s website.

1. **Mueller’s report will reportedly be “lightly redacted”** and is expected to reveal details about Trump’s actions in office that came under scrutiny. According to an outline the Justice Department used to brief the White House with, Mueller did not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice because he couldn’t determine Trump’s intent behind his actions. Separately, the Justice Department will let a “limited number” of lawmakers review Mueller’s report “without certain redactions, including removing the redaction of information related to the charges set forth in the indictment in this case.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/attorney-general-to-provide-overview-of-mueller-report-at-news-conference-before-its-release/2019/04/17/8dcc9440-54b9-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?noredirect=on))

2. **Barr said Trump will not be invoking executive privilege over any information contained in Mueller's report.** He said the White House counsel was permitted to review a redacted version of the report, but insisted that "no material has been redacted based on executive privilege."

3. **House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler accused Barr of “waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump.”** Nadler charged that Barr was attempting to “bake in the narrative to the benefit of the White House” and to protect Trump by holding a news conference about Mueller’s report hours before it will be made public. Nadler and other House committee chairs issued a joint statement urging Barr to cancel the news conference and “let the full report speak for itself.” The House Judiciary Committee plans to review the redacted report, and then ask Mueller and his team to testify before Congress.

4. **North Korea said continued nuclear talks would be "lousy" if Sec. of State Mike Pompeo remains involved**, demanding that Pompeo be replaced by someone who is "more careful." A North Korean foreign ministry official said last week that Pompeo "spouted reckless remarks, hurting the dignity of our supreme leadership" after he agreed with the characterization of Kim Jong-un as a tyrant. That same official warned on Thursday that if Pompeo remains involved, "the talks will become entangled." ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47971164))
