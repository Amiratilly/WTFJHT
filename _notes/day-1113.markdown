1. **The White House threatened to veto a nearly $4.7 billion emergency aid package to Puerto Rico**. The $4.67 billion aid package passed by Democrats in the House would include $3.26 billion in community development block grants, $1.25 billion for repairs to roads, and tens of millions more for schools, energy, and nutrition assistance programs. In its veto message to Congress, the Office of Management and Budget called the bill "misguided" and warned that multiple "high-profile cases of corruption have marred distribution of aid already appropriated and have led to ongoing political instability on the island." The bill is not expected to pass in the Senate in its current form.
