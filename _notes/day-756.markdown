1. **Trump is dramatically downsizing two teams of federal officials tasked with fighting election interference by foreign countries.** The task forces are part of the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Agency and were assembled in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election. One of the task forces is half the size it was a few months ago, and there are no indications that senior political leadership plans to rebuild it. The other was reduced significantly after the 2018 midterms before its staff could produce a full assessment of what happened during the election. DHS sources say "2020 is going to be the perfect storm." ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-dhs-guts-task-forces-protecting-elections-from-foreign-meddling))

2. **The House voted to stop U.S. funding for Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen.** The move is seen as an attempt to limit presidential war powers and highlight Congress' anger of Trump's refusal to condemn Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey. The vote was 248 to 177 in favor of stopping aid and condemning Saudi campaign, which has killed thousands of civilians and caused a massive famine and an historic cholera outbreak.

3. **Trump is accelerating a secret U.S. program to sabotage Iran's missiles and rockets in an attempt to cripple Iran's military and isolate its economy.** The program has never been publicly acknowledged by U.S. officials, which involves slipping faulty parts and materials into Iran's aerospace supply chains. It was started under the Bush administration and was active early in the Obama administration, but it was winding down by 2017 when Mike Pompeo took over as CIA director and started ramping things up again.

4. **A judge voided Paul Manafort's cooperation deal and ruled that Manafort "intentionally" lied and "made multiple false statements to the FBI, the \[Office of Special Counsel\] and the grand jury concerning matters that were material to the investigation."** Manafort lied about his contacts with his Russian associate during and after the campaign, according to Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Manafort also intentionally lied about $125,000 he received for legal bills, he lied about another unnamed Justice Department criminal investigation, and he lied during and after his time as campaign chair about his interactions with his longtime Russian associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Manafort will not be able to retract his guilty plea, but he will still be required to hold up his end of his plea deal. The ruling does free Mueller's office from having to comply with the obligations in Manafort's cooperation agreement, like offering Manafort a reduced sentence for his cooperation.

5. **A White House security specialist wants official whistleblower protections from the federal government after she raised concerns about "unwarranted security clearances" for top administration officials like Jared Kushner.** Tricia Newbold requested whistleblower protections less than two weeks after she was suspended without pay by her supervisor, Carl Kline. Newbold says Kline "repeatedly mishandled security files and has approved unwarranted security clearances," one of which was Jared Kushner's. Kline overruled Newbold's concerns and approved top-secret security clearance for Kushner and at least 30 White House officials.
