1. **Giuliani says he is preparing a response to Robert Mueller's request for an in-person interview with Trump.** Giuliani says his response will largely rebuff Mueller's latest offer of a presidential interview that includes questions about obstruction of justice. "We have a real reluctance about allowing any questions about obstruction," Giuliani said. He expects to continue negotiating with Mueller, rather than flatly denying Mueller's request, but he also said Trump isn't ready to settle just yet. "The president still hasn’t made a decision, and we’re not going to make a final decision just yet," he added.

2. **The Trump administration is expected to issue a proposal in a few weeks that would make it harder for legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens or obtain green cards if they have ever used social programs like Obamacare.** The move would not require congressional approval, and is part of Stephen Miller's plan to limit the number of migrants who obtain legal status in the U.S. each year. A draft version of the proposal would prevent those who have ever used Obamacare, children's health insurance, food stamps, and other social benefits programs from becoming legal U.S. citizens. It would be the biggest change to the legal immigration system in decades and more than 20 million immigrants could be affected.
