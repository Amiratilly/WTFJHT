1. **A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from using billions of dollars from the Pentagon to pay for the construction of Trump's border wall**. U.S. District Court Judge David Briones in Texas said Trump can't use the $3.6 billion in military construction funding to pay for the 11 wall projects along the southern border with Mexico, and that Trump exceeded his authority when he issued a national emergency declaration to access the money. Judge Briones also said the plaintiffs in the case were entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the government from moving forward.

2. **Trump called the FBI "scum" at a rally in Pennsylvania**. He was referring to members of the FBI who were involved in the investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign. During the rally, Trump also reiterated his claim that the investigation into his campaign was launched by biased individuals within the intelligence community who were intent on undermining his presidency â€” a theory that was debunked by a report from a Trump-appointed inspector general.
