1. **Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is expected to leave his post after the Senate impeachment trial**. Trump aides have been circulating a list of replacements and trying to nudge Trump to choose Mulvaney's successor. Mulvaney has largely been excluded from major personnel and policy decisions and he no longer holds much control over White House staff, despite holding what has historically been one of the most powerful jobs in the White House. "He’s like a kid," said one Republican close to the White House. "His role at the dinner table is to be seen and not heard."

2. **The federal prosecutor tasked with examining the origins of the Russia investigation is looking into the role of former CIA director John Brennan and his communications surrounding the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election**. U.S. Attorney John Durham has requested Brennan's emails, call logs, and other documents from the CIA. Durham wants to know what Brennan told other intelligence officials, including James Comey, about the CIA's view of the infamous Steele dossier and the relationships between Russia and Trump associates. Durham is also looking into whether Brennan privately contradicted his public statements and his 2017 testimony to Congress about the dossier and the debate within the intelligence community over their conclusions regarding Russian election interference.

3. **Trump once said that he believes Ukraine — not Russia — interfered in the 2016 election because Putin told him so**, according to multiple former Trump officials. After a private meeting with Putin in 2017 at the G20 summit, Trump became even insistent about the now-debunked conspiracy, saying he knew Ukraine was the real culprit because "Putin told me."
