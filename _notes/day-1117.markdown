1. **The Trump administration released a $4.8 trillion budget proposal that includes cuts to major domestic and safety net programs**. The proposal would cut Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and drain savings from Medicare, despite Trump's promises that he would protect Medicare and Social Security. It also slashes the EPA's budget by 26.5% and the Health and Human Services budget — which includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Protection — by 9% over the next year. The Department of Education would see an almost 8% cut, the Interior Department would be cut by 13.4%, and Housing and Urban Development would be cut by 15.2%. Trump would increase funding to the Department of Homeland Security and leave the Pentagon's budget at current levels, while adding 12% to NASA's budget. Even if all the proposed cuts are approved by Congress, the budget would still fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years.
