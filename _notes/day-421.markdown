1. **Trump has decided to remove national security adviser H.R. McMaster and is currently considering potential replacements**. Five people with knowledge of Trump's plans say he's comfortable firing McMaster but he wants to take his time with the transition in order to avoid humiliating McMaster and make sure that he has a strong replacement lined up. Other Trump officials like HUD Secretary Ben Carson are also rumored to be on the chopping block, as well as John Kelly and Mick Mulvaney.

2. **Ivanka Trump will meet with the South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha** in the U.S. in the wake of the abrupt firing of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The purpose and date of the meeting have yet to be announced. Kang was originally expected to meet with Tillerson to discuss North Korea, among other issues, before Tillerson was ousted.

3. **Stormy Daniels' lawyer says Daniels was threatened with "physical harm" in response to her claims that she had an affair with Trump in 2006.** "Was she threatened in any way?" Mika Brzezinski asked lawyer Michael Avenatti on MSNBC's *Morning Joe.* Avenatti said she was, and Brzezinski followed up by asking, "Was she threatened physical harm?" Avenatti confirmed that she was, but didn't say what the exact threats were, or whether Trump was the one who personally threatened her.
