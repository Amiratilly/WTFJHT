1. **Trump privately criticized Republican candidate Rick Saccone for being a terrible, "weak" candidate.** This, despite Trump appearing at a rally for Saccone on Saturday and giving [an 80-minute stump speech](https://youtu.be/aZ2ab7RtuDU) that seemed to be mostly in support of Saccone. Trump barely said anything about Saccone during the campaign speech, instead choosing to focus on Oprah, his plan to deal with drug dealers, and his new campaign slogan for 2020: "Keep America Great."
