1. **Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told the U.S. to come up with a mechanism for getting U.S. troops out of Iraq**. During a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mahdi said Iraq rejects all violations of its sovereignty, including both the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil by the U.S. and the barrage of ballistic missiles fired at Iraqi bases by Iranians in retaliation for Soleimani's killing. Mahdi asked Pompeo to "send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliamentâ€™s resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq," according to a statement. The U.S. currently has more than 5,000 troops stationed in Iraq.

2. **A spokesperson for the Iranian government denied reports that Iran shot down the Ukrainian airliner that crashed Wednesday night near Tehran**. Ali Rabiei called the claim "a big lie" and accused the U.S. of spreading misinformation about the crash, which killed all 176 people on board. "No one will assume responsibility for such a big lie once it is known that the claim had been fraudulent," Rabiei said. American, British, and Canadian government intelligence reports suggested the plan may have been shot down unintentionally.
