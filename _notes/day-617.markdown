1. **The American Bar Association is calling on the Senate to postpone a vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation until the FBI can complete an investigation into Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.** "The basic principles that underscore the Senate's constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees", the ABA wrote in a strongly worded letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, "require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI." The ABA previously gave Kavanaugh a rating of "well-qualified" for the Supreme Court.

2. **The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote this morning to move Kavanaugh's confirmation forward.** If one Republican representative on the committee cotes "no" or "present" on the recommendation to move his confirmation forward, Kavanaugh's nomination will not have the full endorsement of the committee. Several Democratic members of the committee walked out of the meeting in protest. Kavanaugh could still get a full Senate confirmation by being referred out of the committee without a recommendation, as was the case with now-Justice Clarence Thomas.

3. **Sen. Jeff Flake says he will vote "yes" on Kavanaugh's confirmation.** Flake's vote virtually ensures that Kavanaugh's confirmation will move forward to a vote from the full Senate. Flake said that he still has "much doubt" after yesterday's hearings with Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, but he believes "our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence."

4. **Leaked emails between Senate staffers and attorneys for one of Kavanaugh's accusers show that a Republican aide refused to take phone calls from Deborah Ramirez**, who alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party in college. Mike Davis repeatedly demanded additional evidence in written form before any conversation about her testimony would be allowed to proceed.

5. **A Russian-born American businessman who donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump's presidential campaign offered to brief a high-ranking official during the waning months of the campaign.** A series of emails reveal that Houston oil executive Simon Kukes bragged about his connections to the Trump campaign and requested a face-to-face meeting with Vyacheslav Pavlovsky, vice president of the state-owned Russian Railways and a former Russian ambassador to Norway. Kukes donated $273,000 to the Trump Victory Committee during the 2016 campaign, and later sent a photo of himself posing with Rudy Giuliani to Khodorkovsky, saying "I was at a dinner with Donald Trump." He added: "I think his chances are very good." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/big-donor-trump-campaign-made-overture-top-russian-official-boasting-n913791))

6. **The Trump administration released an environmental impact statement that predicts the earth's temperature will rise by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.** The administration did not offer the forecast as an argument to fight climate change, instead offering the analysis as evidence that the fate of the planet is already sealed. The draft statement was issued as justification for Trump's decision to freeze fuel efficiency standards for vehicles built after 2020.
