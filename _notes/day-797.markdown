1. **Betsy DeVos struggled to defend her decision to eliminate all $18 million in federal funding for the Special Olympics during a congressional subcommittee meeting.** Members of a House Appropriations subcommittee pushed DeVos on her proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, as well as other special education plans. When asked if she knew how many children would be affected by her plan, DeVos could not provide an answer. "I think that the Special Olympics is an awesome organization," DeVos responded, "one that is well supported by the philanthropic sector as well." The proposed education budget includes roughly $2 billion in cuts to Pell Grants, plus billions of dollars in reductions to about 30 other programs.

2. **House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff doubled down on his claims that he has seen evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.** "Undoubtedly there is collusion," Schiff said during an interview. "We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? . . . It doesn’t appear that was any part of Mueller’s report." House Democrats gave AG William Barr until April 2 to deliver a copy of the Mueller report to Congress.
