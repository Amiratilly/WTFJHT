1. **The House Judiciary Committee is in session to hear the evidence for and against impeaching Trump**. Democratic and Republican lawyers will argue their respective cases and present evidence from the House Intelligence Committee's report on Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into his political rivals. "The central allegation," said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, "is that the president put himself above his country several times, that he sought foreign interference in our elections several times, both for 2016 and 2020, that he sought to cover it up." Nadler said the committee could vote as early as this week on at least two or more articles of impeachment against Trump.
