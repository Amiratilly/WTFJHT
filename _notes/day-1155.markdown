1. **Two members of Congress tested positive for the coronavirus.** Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams revealed their test results on Wednesday, making them the first two members of Congress to contract the virus. Balart said he started noticing symptoms on Saturday after voting on the floor of the House to approve the coronavirus response bill. McAdams said his symptoms also began on Saturday night. Rep. Drew Ferguson has also been advised to self-quarantine until March 27 after a House doctor informed him that he had "contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19."

2. **The Department of Agriculture is fighting to implement drastic changes to SNAP benefits, despite a federal judgeâ€™s ruling that it would be "arbitrary and capricious" to move forward during a global health crisis.** The new rules were set to go into effect on April 1, but Judge Beryl Howell ordered a freeze on the changes in a ruling last week. The new rules would eliminate states' ability to waive work and time requirements for SNAP recipients in areas with high unemployment rates. The changes are expected to kick roughly 700,000 people off the program if enacted. ([PBS Newshour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/usda-fights-to-purge-food-stamps-recipients-despite-pandemic))
