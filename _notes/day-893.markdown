1. **Inspectors warned the DHS in May that conditions at an El Paso migrant detention facility were so bad that border agents were arming themselves against possible riots**. Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, however, claimed on Friday that reports of poor conditions for children at the facility were "unsubstantiated." The internal report noted after a May 7 tour of the facility that there were only four showers available for the 756 immigrants, more than half of the immigrants were being held outside, and there were five times as many people being held in cells than the max capacity allowed. One cell was so overcrowded that the men inside could not lie down to sleep, and temperatures in the cells were often higher than 80 degrees. "With limited access to showers and clean clothing," the report said, "detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks."

2. **A federal judge has ordered US Customs and Border Patrol to let health experts into the detention facilities where migrant children are being held** in order to assess the children's needs and to make sure the facilities are "safe and sanitary." The order includes all CPB facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley sectors. Last week, lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee to hold the Trump administration in contempt and to order immediate improvements at the facilities. Judge Gee made the ruling on Friday, despite requests from Attorney General William Barr and others that the court "set a schedule for briefing these issues that provides defendants with a full and fair opportunity to respond to the allegations that plaintiffs have lodged against them."
