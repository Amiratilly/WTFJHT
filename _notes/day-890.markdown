1. **Robert Mueller has agreed to testify before the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees in back-to-back open sessions on July 17**. The announcement came after the chairmen of the two panels issued a subpoena compelling Mueller's testimony. Mueller did not want to testify and has said that his report should serve as his testimony, but he says he will respect the subpoena. "It seemed like such an obvious step, from my own point of view," said House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, "if you're going accept the role as special counsel in one of the most significant investigations in modern history, you're going to have to expect that you're going to be asked to come to testify before Congress."

* **Mueller’s team may think it is done. Democrats have other ideas**. Democrats struggling to find witnesses to guide their Trump probes say they’ve noticed the recent uptick in activity from ex-Mueller staffers — and they want in.

1. **The House approved the $4.5 billion aid package for the southwestern border**. The 230-195 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with all but four Democrats supporting bill: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley. Even if the two chambers are able to reach an agreement, however, it's unclear if Trump will sign it into law. Democrats will now have to begin negotiations with Senate GOP leaders in order to get the aid package signed into law before the weeklong recess.

2. **Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the U.S. is "about 90% of the way there" on a trade deal with China**. Mnuchin says he expects Trump and President Xi to make progress during the upcoming G20 Summit. "The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue \[negotiating\]," Mnuchin said, "because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship." He did not provide any details about what the remaining 10% of an agreement might look like. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html))

3. **Trump's diplomatic protocol chief has been suspended indefinitely ahead of the G20 Summit in Japan, pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct**. Sean Lawler is being investigated by the State Department inspector general, which is looking into accusations that Lawler intimidated his staff and carried a whip in the office. The protocol chief assists the president during overseas trips and during visits from foreign leaders by making introductions and briefing the president on customs and protocol. Mary-Kate Fisher will take over as acting protocol chief.
