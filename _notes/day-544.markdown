1. **The U.S. Treasury will no longer require certain tax-exempt organizations like the NRA and Planned Parenthood to identify their financial donors to the IRS.** Traditional charity groups like 501(c)(3) organizations will still be required to disclose their donors to U.S. tax authorities, but Super PACS and other 501(c)(4) organizations will not. "Americans shouldn’t be required to send the IRS information that it doesn’t need to effectively enforce our tax laws," said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, "and the IRS simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area."
