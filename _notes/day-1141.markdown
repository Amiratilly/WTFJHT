1. **The International Criminal Court ruled that its chief prosecutor could open an investigation into allegations of U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.** The U.S. is not a party to the Rome Statute, the court's founding document, and does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction. The ruling marks the first time the ICC has authorized an investigation into American forces in the 15 years since it was formed to seek justice for victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The ICC says it has gathered enough evidence to prove that U.S. forces "committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence" in 2003 and 2004, and later at CIA black sites in Poland, Romania and Lithuania.
