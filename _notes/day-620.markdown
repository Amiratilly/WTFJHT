1. **The White House is limiting the scope of the FBI's investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.** Only the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez will be investigated, and the White House has provided a list of witnesses the FBI will be permitted to interview. Trump claimed that he did not place any limits on the FBI, but the FBI said it has not received any new instructions that would change the limits imposed by the White House counsel's office â€” including a specific list of witnesses that does not include Kavanaugh's third accuser, Julie Swetnick.

2. **Sens. Jeff Flake and Chris Coons said that if the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh finds that he lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee then his nomination would likely not move forward.** During an interview, Flake and Coons were asked, "If Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee, nomination's over?" Flake responded, "Oh yes." Coons added: "I would think so." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/politics/flake-fbi-kavanaugh-investigation/index.html))
