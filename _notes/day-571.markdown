1. **Omarosa released two secret audio recordings she made: One of John Kelly firing her from inside the Situation Room and one of a phone call she had with Trump after she was fired.** The second recording appears to show that Trump had no idea that Kelly fired her. Current White House staffers are looking into possible legal action to prevent Omarosa from releasing any more tapes and to punish her for secretly recording John Kelly in the Situation Room.
