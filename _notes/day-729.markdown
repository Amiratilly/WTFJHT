1. **The wife of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker sent an email to a reporter and said Mueller's investigation is "wrapping up."** Marci Whitaker was responding to an article in Slate that criticized her husband and argued that the Senate should not confirm him as the next attorney general. She objected to the reporter's suggestion that Whitaker should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. "If abundance of caution is the standard," she wrote, "anyone who ever spent 5 minutes contemplating the topic would need to do so." She continued: "And by all means, assume that a person who speculated on a hypothetical scenario would then put some dark plan into motion, when by all accounts, the investigation is wrapping up and they \[sic\] eyes of the nation are upon them."
