1. **A judge is expected to reconsider whether an associate of Rudy Giuliani should remain on house arrest while he awaits trial for charges of illegally funneling money into a pro-Trump election committee** and to other politicians. Igor Fruman's attorney is scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan to argue that Fruman should not be subject to house arrest or electronic GPS monitoring as conditions of his bail, calling the restrictions "onerous." Fruman was arrested at the airport while attempting to leave the country with his alleged co-conspirator, Lev Parnas, but Fruman's attorney argues that Fruman does not pose a flight risk because he has already paid his $1 million bond and agreed to have his travel restricted.

2. **Trump officially changed his state of residence from New York to Florida**. Trump filed a "declaration of domicile" in late September, which declared that his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach will now be his permanent residence. Melania Trump also changed her residence to Palm Beach in an identical document. Trump confirmed the decision on Twitter. "I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," Trump tweeted. "Few have been treated worse." He added that moving to Florida would be "best for all concerned."

3. **Trump's personal pastor joined the Trump administration in an official capacity**. Paula White is a Florida-based televangelist and personal pastor to Trump. White is a controversial figure even among evangelical Christians, but she will now be in charge of overseeing a White House division that conducts outreach to key parts of the president’s base. White's work in the Public Liaison Office will include advising the administration’s Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which Trump established last year to give religious groups more of a voice in government programs involving religious liberty and fighting poverty.
