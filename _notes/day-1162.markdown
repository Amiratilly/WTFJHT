1. **The Senate passed a $2 trillion relief package to address the economic impacts of the coronavirus.** The bill passed with a unanimous vote of 96-0. The package includes direct payments to individuals making less than $99,000 per year — which could be sent out as early as April 6 — $250 billion to bolster unemployment insurance, $500 billion for hard-hit industries and states, $50 billion for airlines, $350 billion in loans for small businesses that are eligible for loan forgiveness if companies use them to keep workers on payroll, $130 billion in aid to hospitals, and $150 billion to help state and local governments. The bill now heads to the House, where lawmakers are expected to vote on it Friday morning.

2. **The Trump administration fired more than two-thirds of the staff working at a key U.S. public health agency operating in China leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.** Staff at the Beijing office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was slashed from roughly 47 people to just 14 people since Trump took office. The CDC has worked in China for the last 30 years. "The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self," said one U.S. official who worked in China during the drawdown. The National Science Foundation and the USAID office, which helped China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shuttered their Beijing offices on Trump’s watch.

3. **The Trump administration ignored a White House playbook that was created in 2016 to help fight back against a potential pandemic.** The 69-page National Security Council playbook lays out several strategies and recommendations that an administration should take, including moving swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, securing supplemental funding and considering invoking the Defense Production Act, and making sure there are sufficient personal protective equipment available for healthcare workers. The NSC created the guide — officially titled the "Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents" but known colloquially as "the pandemic playbook" — in 2016 and the Trump administration was briefed on it in 2017, but administration officials ignored it and it never became official policy.
