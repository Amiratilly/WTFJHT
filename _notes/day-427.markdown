1. **Jeff Sessions is telling prosecutors to seek the death penalty in drug-related cases whenever it's "appropriate."** The move comes less than a week after Trump called for the execution of opioid dealers and traffickers. “In the face of all of this death, we cannot continue with business as usual,” Sessions wrote in a memo to U.S. Attorneys offices.

2. **Washington D.C. and Maryland filed a lawsuit against Trump for violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution**, which prohibits public officials from receiving gifts and payments from foreign governments without approval from Congress. The suit claims that Trump's refusal to divest from his personal businesses has allowed foreign governments to pay the Trump Organization directly for bookings and events. The suit also claims that businesses in Maryland and D.C. have lost out on potential earnings because groups are choosing to stay at Trump's properties in the hopes that it will gain favor with the president.
