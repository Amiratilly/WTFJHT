1. **The Turkish government told U.S. officials that they have audio and video recordings that prove Jamal Khashoggi was tortured and killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.** The recordings show that Khashoggi was detained inside the consulate by a Saudi security team before being killed and dismembered. “You can hear his voice and the voices of men speaking Arabic” on the audio recording of the incident, one person with knowledge of the recording said. “You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/turks-tell-us-officials-they-have-audio-and-video-recordings-that-support-conclusion-khashoggi-was-killed/2018/10/11/119a119e-cd88-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html?utm_term=.7db203fc57e8))
