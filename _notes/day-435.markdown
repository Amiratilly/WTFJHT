1. **The Department of Housing and Urban Development is attempting to reverse federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws**. Under Ben Carson, HUD has been freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses while sidelining officials who have attempted to pursue civil rights cases. The goal is to roll back the Obama administration's efforts to reverse racial, ethnic, and income segregation in housing and development projects subsidized by the federal government. The move comes despite the fact that the agency now has more leverage and funding than ever thanks to block grants it received in the wake of the hurricanes last year that hit the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico.
