1. **China will impose tariffs on 128 U.S. goods in response to Trump's new tariffs on steel and aluminum**. The new Chinese tariffs will take effect on Monday and will effect more than $3 billion in U.S. exports to China. Among the tariffs are a 15 percent increase on American fruit and nuts and a 25 percent tariff on pork, recycled aluminum, and more.

2. **Trump took to Twitter over the weekend to rail against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program**, known as DACA. "NO MORE DACA DEAL," he tweeted just hours after tweeting "HAPPY EASTER." He also claimed that "A lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA," even though the program is only available to people who have lived in the U.S. since 2007.
