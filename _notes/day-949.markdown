1. **Trump suggested on multiple occasions to senior Homeland Security and national security officials that they should look into using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from reaching the U.S.** "Why don't we nuke them?" Trump reportedly asked at one hurricane briefing at the White House. One source paraphrased Trump's statements: "They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't we do that?" Trump has been asking advisers about the feasibility of using explosives to stop hurricanes from making landfall since at least 2017, as described in an NSC memo.

2. **A network of conservative operatives allied with the White House is attempting to discredit news organizations that Trump doesn't like by publishing damaging information about journalists who work for them**. The group compiles dossiers of embarrassing social media posts and other public statements made by journalists who work at some of the largest news organizations in country, including CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times. The research also reportedly extends to the family members of journalists, liberal activists, and other political opponents of Trump.
