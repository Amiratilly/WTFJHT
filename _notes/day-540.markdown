1. **The White House ordered the FBI to give lawmakers more access to classified information about the informant used in 2016 to investigate possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.** The director of national intelligence and the director of the FBI have tried to keep access to the classified documents tightly limited, but the files will now be made available to all members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

2. **Jared Kushner doesn't have the necessary security clearance required to review some of the government's most sensitive  secrets.** Until late May, Kushner had nearly unfettered access to highly classified intelligence, even though he only had interim security clearance while he waited for his background check to clear. Now, he has "top secret" clearance, but that level of clearance doesn't allow him to see some of the nation's most classified intelligence, known as "sensitive compartmental information," or SCI.

3. **Trump said he won't rule out ceasing NATO military exercises in the Baltic States if Putin requested it during their upcoming meeting in Helsinki.** Joint exercises involving 17 nations, including hundreds of U.S. troops and several warships, are currently underway in the Black Sea. If Trump chooses to pull the U.S. out of the military exercises, NATO allies could still conduct them on their own, but they would likely be forced to carry them out under a different banner since the U.S. can veto labeling them as NATO exercises.

4. **Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that he will sell all of the remaining stock he holds after he received a letter from the government's top ethics watchdog warning of "potential for a serious criminal violation."** The letter was sent by the Acting Director and General Counsel for the Office of Government Ethics, and faulted Ross for what it said were various omissions and inaccurate statements submitted by Ross to the OGE over the last year. The letter also faulted Ross for shorting certain positions that "appear to have been an ineffective attempt to remedy your actual or apparent failure to timely divest assets per your ethics agreement."
