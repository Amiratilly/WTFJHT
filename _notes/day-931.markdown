1. **Mitch McConnell's campaign has been locked out of Twitter after sharing a video of a profanity-laced protest outside of the McConnell's home in Louisville**. "The user was temporarily locked out of their account for a Tweet that violated our violent threats policy," a Twitter spokesperson said, "specifically threats involving physical safety." McConnell's campaign manager said the action by Twitter was part of a "problem with the speech police in America today." He continued: "Twitter will allow the words of 'Massacre Mitch' to trend nationally on their platform but locks our account for posting actual threats against us." The campaign appealed the decision but Twitter stood by its decision and the account remains locked until they delete the video.

2. **The White House is preparing an executive order to address allegations of anti-conservative bias by social media companies**. The contents of the order remain unknown, and some say there have been many different versions circulating among White House officials. Last month, Trump said he was exploring "all regulatory and legislative solutions" to deal with the supposed issue.

3. **White House officials refused to requests from their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats like those from white nationalists a greater priority**. The [National Strategy for Counterterrorism](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/NSCT.pdf) specifically spells out recommendations, but those suggestions went unheeded. "Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism," said one senior DHS source. "The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home." Instead of taking the threats more seriously, the White House simply added a single paragraph about domestic terrorism "as a throwaway line" to the document.

4. **An Iraqi man from Detroit was deported back to Iraq as part of Trump's intensified immigration enforcement efforts, where he died on Tuesday**. Jimmy Aldaoud was deported back to Iraq, where he was unable to get access to the insulin he needed to treat his diabetes in Baghdad. Aldaoud was an Iraqi national who was born in Greece and came to the United States as a young child. He had never lived in Iraq and did not speak Arabic. "Jimmy Aldaoud ... should have never been sent to Iraq," said Rep. Andy Levin in a statement. "My Republican colleagues and I have repeatedly called on the executive branch to cease deportation of such vulnerable people. Now, someone has died."

5. **Kimberly Breier resigned her position as assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere**, leaving a vacancy at the top diplomatic office in charge of Trump's efforts to deal with immigration from Mexico and Central America. The position is also in charge of building stronger relationships between the U.S. and South America. Breier has held the position since October. She referred questions about her departure to the State Department press office, which refused to comment. Officials said Breier was not necessarily opposed to Trump's policies, but she did not like the  amount of control exerted by the White House over immigration and trade relations with Mexico and other issues.
