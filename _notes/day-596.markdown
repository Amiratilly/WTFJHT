3. **Trump: "If it was up to me, I’d shut down government over border security." Also Trump, a day earlier: "I don’t see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now."** Trump has gone back and forth about the possibility of a government shutdown at the end of the month. Recently, he said he'd prefer to wait until after the midterms to shut down the government in order to avoid hurting Republican candidates' chances of winning. "We need Republicans elected in the midterms," Trump said. "We are getting the wall done. But I've had so many people, good people, great people, \[say\] they would rather not do \[it\] before \[the midterms\], they'd rather do it right after the election."
