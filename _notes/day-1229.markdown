1. **The top lawyer for the FBI was forced to resign by the Justice Department over his role in the Michael Flynn investigation**. Dana Boente was asked to step down by senior figures at the DOJ, and two sources said the order came from "Attorney General William Barrâ€™s justice department." Boente was the one who signed off on a warrant in 2017 authorizing the FBI to conduct surveillance on Flynn. He also signed one of the reauthorizations to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Several of Trump's supporters have recently gone on Fox News and other conservative media outlets to criticize Boente's brief role in the Russia probe. Boente spent nearly 40 years at the FBI as its general counsel and a former acting attorney general.
