1. **Chief Justice John Roberts told Senators that he will not read the name of the whistleblower aloud or publicly relay any questions that might unmask the official**. Sen. Rand Paul composed questions that violated Roberts' order and was unable to ask them during the Senate impeachment trial proceedings.
