1. **Mueller wrote a letter to William Barr in late March complaining that Barr's four-page summary of the special counsel's 400-page report "did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance" of his work.** The letter was sent on March 27, just days after Barr announced that Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. In his letter to Barr, Mueller complained that Barr's summary was inadequate and called on Barr to release the report's introductions and executive summaries in order to alleviate some of the public confusion about the report's conclusions on the obstruction of justice question. "There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation," Mueller wrote. "This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations." The day after Mueller sent the letter to Barr, the two men spoke on the phone and Mueller said he was concerned that the media coverage of his investigation into possible obstruction of justice was misguided as a result of Barr's summary memo. On April 9, however, Barr testified to Congress that Mueller had declined an opportunity to review his four-page summary of Mueller's findings. Barr has also testified previously that he did not know whether Mueller supported his conclusion on the question of possible obstruction. Barr is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee today starting at 10 a.m. ET.

1. **Barr says the Justice Department is done talking about the Mueller report.** In his prepared remarks for his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr says that "from here on, the exercise of responding and reacting to the report is a matter for the American people and the political process."

2. **A federal judge ruled that Congressional Democrats can move forward with their lawsuit against Trump alleging that his private business represent unconstitutional gifts or payments from foreign governments.** Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington allowed the emoluments case to move forward and refused a request from the White House to dismiss the case under Trump's narrow definition of the word "emoluments." The case alleges that, without seeking approval from Congress, Trump received payments from foreign governments for hotel rooms and events, plus licensing fees for his show "The Apprentice" and intellectual property rights from China.
