1. **The Russian disinformation and influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election made a significant effort to target African-Americans, suppress Democratic voter turnout, and was even more active on Instagram than it was on Facebook.** A report produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee found that "active and ongoing interference operations remain on several platforms," including one campaign to bolster support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and influence opinions on the Syrian Civil War. "What is clear," a second report concludes, "is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party â€” and specifically Donald Trump." The report continues: "Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting."
