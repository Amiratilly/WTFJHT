1. **An investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee found no evidence that Ukraine attempted to interfere in the 2016 election**. The Republican-led committee was investigating claims by Trump and his allies that Ukraine launched a top-down interference campaign against Trump, similar to the one Russia engaged in to help get Trump elected. Trump has used those claims to defend his demands for political investigations from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Committee Chairman Richard Burr said that while some Ukrainian officials actively supported Hillary Clinton, "I don't think anybody interfered in the same way Russia did."

2. **Ukraine knew about Trump's hold on U.S. military aid in July and attempted to keep the information from going public**, according to a former Ukrainian deputy defense minister. Olena Zerkal learned about the freeze from an incoming diplomatic cable and informed Ukrainian senior officials, who tried to prevent it from surfacing in order to avoid getting drawn into the impeachment discussion. Zerkal's planned trip to the U.S. was also canceled over concerns that she might discuss issues related to impeachment and make Zelensky more of a central figure in the impeachment inquiry. Zerkal's statements are the first public acknowledgement by a Ukrainian official that senior members of the Zelensky administration knew about the freeze during the Trump administration's campaign to pressure Zelensky into launching investigations into Trump's political rivals.
