1. **Trump gave his second State of the Union speech last night.** He started by calling for unity and bipartisanship, before launching into attacks on Robert Mueller's investigation, calls for Congress to fund his border wall, and plans to enact a new ban on abortion. Democrats responded by calling the speech "sickening," "shameful," and "inappropriate." Sen. Mazie Hirono simply replied, "WTF." Republicans, meanwhile, erupted into chants of "USA! USA! USA!" during the speech and largely curbed whatever criticisms they had in once it was over.  ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/06/state-of-the-union-2019-highlights-1149918))

2. **The audience for the SOTU address was deeply Republican, the most partisan audience since 2001.** The slant in the audience led to largely positive reviews from those who watched – about 6 in 10 viewers had a positive reaction to the speech. The positive remarks were cut down party and demographic lines. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/state-of-the-union-poll/index.html))

3. **During a private lunch for TV anchors earlier in the day, Trump attacked prominent Democrats.** He called Joe Biden "dumb," called Chuck Schumer a "nasty son of a bitch," and said Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam "choked like a dog" during a news conference where he tried to explain the racist photo in his medical school yearbook. He also repeated his slur against Elizabeth Warren: "I hope I haven’t wounded Pocahontas too badly,” Trump said. “I’d like to run against her."

4. **Archival footage shows Trump meeting with officials in Russia in the 1990s to discuss a possible building project in Russia.** The video was allegedly aired by Russian state TV in 1995, and shows Trump meeting with members of the former mayor of Moscow's administration. "He had contacts," former mayor Yury Luzhkov said, "on matters related to the construction of the Okhotny Ryad underground mall on Manezh Square." The video was apparently discovered by someone who had "going through the Russian TV archives."
