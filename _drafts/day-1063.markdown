The House alleges that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, as well as a probe of a debunked theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened debate on the articles of impeachment against Trump, declaring that lawmakers are "custodians of the Constitution" and "If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty." She added: Trump's "reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice."

The House held six hours of debate, divided equally between Republicans and Democrats, on the two articles.

tK/ **The Trump administration is fighting a new package of sanctions on Russia**, which is designed to punish Russian individuals and companies over the Kremlin's targeting of Ukraine, 2016 election interference, its activities in Syria, and its attacks on dissidents.

Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced the bill earlier this year, which passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week.
