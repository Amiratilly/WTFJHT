TK/ The Justice Department sent redacted copies ofJames Comey's memos – 15 pages in total – to Congress.   

Trump told Mr. Comey that he had serious reservations about Michael T. Flynn

Comey recounts how Trump at a private White House dinner pointed his fingers at his head and complained that Flynn, his embattled national security adviser, “has serious judgment issues.”

The memos reveal that days before Flynn’s firing, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asked Comey if Flynn’s communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.

The memos cover the first three months of the Trump administration

* **Putin once told Trump that Russia has "some of the most beautiful hookers in the world,"** according to Comey. In a memo dated Feb. 8, 2017, Comey writes that Trump "brought up the 'Golden Showers thing,'" saying that "'the hookers thing' is nonsense."

* **Comey explained why he thinks "it's possible" that Russia has compromising information on Trump**. First, he says, is that "the President is constantly bringing it up with me to deny it." And, second, Trump "wouldn't criticize Vladimir Putin even in private, which struck me as odd." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/james-comey-jake-tapper-cnntv/index.html))
