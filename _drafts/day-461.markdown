1/ **A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must resume accepting new DACA applications**, saying the Department of Homeland Security's legal explanation for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was "arbitrary," "capricious," and predicated on "virtually unexplained" grounds and therefore "unlawful." DHS now has 90 days to better explain its reasoning for canceling the program, or the judge will rescind the government memo that terminated the program.

2/ **Mick Mulvaney advised bankers and lobbyists that increasing campaign contributions would help weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – the agency he runs**. Mulvaney capped off his speech at a American Bankers Association conference by arguing that trying to sway legislators with campaign contributions was one of the "fundamental underpinnings of our representative democracy."

3/ **In 2015, Ronny Jackson drunkenly banged on the hotel room door of a female employee in the middle of the night**. The Secret Service stopped him out of concern that he would wake then-President Barack Obama. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/politics/ronny-jackson-door-allegations/index.html))

* **Jackson was known as "the candy man" inside the White House** for "hand\[ing\] out the prescription drugs like they were candy." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/politics/tester-va-ronny-jackson/index.html))

4/ **Scott Pruitt's head of security moonlighted for American Media Inc. during the 2016 presidential campaign**. A.M.I. owns the National Enquirer, which purchased the rights to Karen McDougal's story about her alleged affair with Trump. A.M.I.'s chairman, David Pecker, is a close friend of Trump's. Pasquale Perrotta received a waiver from the EPA under the Obama administration to hold outside employment. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/pasquale-perrotta-epa-american-media.html))

5/ **Trump praised Kim Jong Un as a "very honorable" person** and expressed hope their meeting will occur "as soon as possible." Trump sidestepped the question when asked to explain his comment that Kim is an "honorable" person, whom he once mocked as "Little Rocket Man." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/politics/trump-kim-jong-un-honorable/index.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384600-trump-calls-kim-jong-un-very-honorable))

6/ **Don Blankenship is running for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia while living in a $2.4 million villa in Nevada**. Blankenship also leans hard on America First-style economic and campaign branding, despite expressing admiration for China's state-controlled economy and interest in obtaining Chinese citizenship for himself. Blankenship is known for spending a year in prison for his involvement in a coal mining explosion that killed 29 people during his time as a coal mining executive. Blankenship, however, is currently running for Senate as a champion of miners and using ads to dispute the settled facts regarding his role in the explosion.
