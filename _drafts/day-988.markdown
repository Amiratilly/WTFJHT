TK/ **Three House committees released documents and text messages provided by former American Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker**. The texts show how senior State Department officials coordinated with Giuliani and the Ukrainian president’s top aide to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 presidential election and an energy company that employed Biden's son. The texts also show that officials felt Trump would not agree to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless Zelensky publicly promised to launch the investigations. Democrats say the texts are clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing "to launch politically motivated investigations."

tK/ Ukraine's prosecutor general's office is now **reviewing a criminal case involving the owner of a natural gas company that employed Biden's son**. 

Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said he intended to review 15 cases in all, including investigations of wealthy Ukrainians, like the owner of the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board until earlier this year. The prosecutor didn't say how long the audit would last, but at a news conference in Kiev Ryaboshapka said "the key words were not Biden and not Burisma."

TK/ **Energy Secretary Rick Perry is planning to step down from his post by the end of the year and pledged to cooperate with lawmakers investigating a whistleblower's allegations about Trump's communications with Zelensky**. Perry met with Zelensky at least three times while in office. Perry is expected to return to the private sector once he resigns in November. He is among the longest-serving members of Trump’s Cabinet.

TK/ **The Supreme Court agreed to review a restrictive Louisiana law that requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles**. The Louisiana law, enacted in 2014, would leave the state with only one doctor eligible to perform the procedure. The requirement is similar to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, finding it posed an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to access an abortion. A decision is expected in the summer of 2020.

TK/ **Iranian hackers unsuccessfully attempted to identify, attack, and breach 241 email accounts associated with current and former U.S. government officials, journalists, prominent Iranians outside Iran, and one U.S. presidential campaign**. Microsoft said that it had seen "significant cyber activity" from a group of hackers that it believes "originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government," who made more than 2,700 attempts to identify e-mail addresses between August and September.
