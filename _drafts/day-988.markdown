TK/ **Text messages reveal how two U.S. ambassadors coordinated with Rudy Giuliani and a top Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky aide to leverage a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky into persuading Kiev to publicly commit to investigating Joe Biden**.

Three House committees released the documents and text messages provided by Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, which show Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland repeatedly stressing that a White House meeting depended on getting the Ukrainians to agree to the exact language that Zelensky would use in announcing an investigation. In August, Volker proposed to Sondland that they have Zelensky cite "alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians" in interference in U.S. elections when announcing an investigation. Democrats say the texts are clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing "to launch politically motivated investigations."

tK/ **Ukraine's prosecutor general's office is now reviewing a criminal case involving the owner of a natural gas company that employed Biden's son**. Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said he intended to review 15 cases in all, including investigations of wealthy Ukrainians, like the owner of the natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board until earlier this year. Riaboshapka said the decision to review the closed cases came after he took office in August – after a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ryaboshapka didn't say how long the audit would last, but at a news conference in Kiev he said "the key words were not Biden and not Burisma."

TK/ **The Supreme Court agreed to review a restrictive Louisiana law that requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles**. The Louisiana law, enacted in 2014, would leave the state with only one doctor eligible to perform the procedure. The requirement is similar to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, finding it posed an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to access an abortion. A decision is expected in the summer of 2020.
