TK/ **The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine testified that Trump's comment to the Ukraine president – that she was "bad news" and is "going to go through some things" – "sounded like a threat."** Marie Yovanovitch, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, said she was "shocked, absolutely shocked, and devastated" when she read the rough transcript released by the White House of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Yovanovitch was recalled from her posting on April 24 – three days after Trump's first call with Zelensky – while in the middle of hosting an event honoring an anti-corruption activist in Ukraine.

* **Yovanovitch suggested that Trump and Rudy Giuliani ran a "the smear campaign against" her in tandem with corrupt Ukrainians, which undermined U.S. national security**, emboldened Russia, and "kneecapped" her from doing her job. Yovanovitch said Giuliani ran a "campaign of disinformation," which was influenced by "individuals with questionable motives" who believed their "political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine." Yovanovitch also criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the State Department's failed efforts to publicly support her after Trump removed her as ambassador.

tK/ **Trump attacked Yovanovitch on Twitter as she was testifying about how she felt threatened by his comments**. Trump tweeted that "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad," claiming that Zelensky had "spoke unfavorably about her." Trump also called it his "absolute right to appoint ambassadors," justifying his decision to recall Yovanovitch three months before the end of the normal three-year diplomatic tenure. When asked by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff to respond to Trump's tweets, Yovanovitch called it "very intimidating \[...\] the effect is to be intimidating." Schiff responded that "it's designed to intimidate" and that "we saw today witness intimidation in real time by the president of the United States." Schiff added: "Some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously."

TK/ **The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine will testify publicly today as part of the House impeachment inquiry**. Marie Yovanovitch is expected to tell House investigators about how she became the target of a smear campaign by Rudy Giuliani which eventually led to her ouster from the State Department. Yovanovitch had already been removed from her post by the time Trump had his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but she was able to witness the early stages of Trump and Giuliani's efforts to influence Ukrainian policy and pressure Zelensky to investigate Trump's political rivals.

TK/ **The White House released a rough transcript of Trump's first call in April with Ukrainian President Zelensky**. The call is mostly congratulatory, with Trump expressing confidence in Zelensky's leadership and telling him that the U.S. is "with you all the way." Trump tells Zelensky that he plans to invite him to the White House "when you're settled and ready" because they "have a lot of things to talk about."

TK/ **Trump met with Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone in the Oval Office to discuss the DOJ inspector general's probe into the origins of the Mueller investigation**. Inspector General Michael Horowitz began his investigation in early 2018. His goal is to examine the applications submitted by the FBI in 2016 and 2017 that sought permission to surveil Trump's then-campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Barr said Wednesday that the report is "imminent." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/trump-barr-cipollone-horowitz-report/index.html))

tK/ **Roger Stone was found guilty on all seven counts** of lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks, witness tampering, and obstructing the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Minutes after the verdict, Trump tweeted that the outcome was unfair despite his administration's Justice Department leading the prosecution. Stone is the sixth Trump associate to be convicted on charges stemming from Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian activity in the 2016 election. He faces a legal maximum penalty of 50 years in prison – 20 years for witness tampering, and five years for each of the six other counts.
