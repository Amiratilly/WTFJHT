1/ **Michael Cohen's business partner agreed to cooperate with the government as a potential witness as part of a plea deal**. Evgeny Freidman is a Russian immigrant known as the Taxi King, and he specifically agreed to assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, according to "a person briefed on the matter." Freidman's cooperation is seen as potential leverage to pressure Cohen into working with Mueller's team on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.

2/ **Scott Pruitt spent at least $9,600 on decorations and furniture for his personal office**. Pruitt bought Smithsonian artwork, a refurbished desk, and other framed items. He paid the Smithsonian Institution $1,950 in labor and delivery charges to rent out three art pieces for his executive suite, and spent more than $2,500 on frames for various items, including a photo of himself with Trump and an American flag. The internal document with the list of expenditures also confirmed earlier reports that agency officials spent $2,963 on a standing "captain's" desk and $2,075 on a different desk, both of which belonged to Pruitt.
