TK/ Trump authorized a drone strike at Baghdad International Airport that killed Iran's top security and intelligence commander late Thursday. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon had taken "decisive defensive action" and killed Qasem Soleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, because he "was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region." Soleimani was the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades.Esper also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. Speaking to reporters while on vacation at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday – hours after the attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad – Trump insisted that he did not want war, saying "I want to have peace. I like peace."

TK/ 

The Trump administration has yet to publicly explain the legal justification for killing Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, prompting Democratic lawmakers to question whether the President had the authority to order the strike without Congressional approval and raise concerns that Iran's potential response was not fully considered.
