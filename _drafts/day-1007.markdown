TK/ **Trump's lawyer argued that Trump would be immune from prosecution while in office â€“ even if he shot someone**. William Consovoy, Trump's lawyer, made the claim while arguing before a federal appeals court in their suit against Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who has subpoenaed for three years' worth of financial records from the Trump Organization and for Trump-related business records and his personal tax record  from the accounting firm Mazars USA. Consovoy argued that while in office, Trump "enjoys absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind," but conceded that "once a president is removed from office" he could then be subject to a criminal investigation. Judges on the three-member panel expressed skepticism about the argument with Judge Denny Chin asking whether "nothing could be done" while Trump remains in office, to which Consovoy replied: "That is correct." As a candidate in 2016, Trump claimed he could "stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody" and not "lose any voters."

### Notables.

1. **Russia and Turkey reached a deal to push Kurdish fighters out of northeastern Syria, allowing Russia's ally Bashar al-Assad to regain control over more of the country's territory**. The agreement was reached after an hours-long meeting between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Once the operation is complete, Turkey and Russia will control territory formerly held by Kurdish forces who were once allied with the U.S. before Trump ordered an abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region. Under the agreement, Russia and the Syrian government planned to begin removing Kurdish militias starting at noon on Wednesday from a large part of the border that extends hundreds of miles from the Euphrates River to Iraq, an area more than 20 miles deep.

2. **Turkey halted its incursion into Kurdish-run Syria just hours after reaching a deal with the Russian government to retake roughly 900 square miles of territory from the Kurds**. "At this stage," the Turkish defense ministry said in a statement, "there is no further need to conduct a new operation outside the present operation area." Kurdish authorities were not involved in the talks between Putin and Erdogan, and they have yet to respond to the deal. In earlier rounds of talks, the Kurds agreed to completely withdraw from a central stretch of the Syrian border with Turkey and allow Russian and Syrian government troops inside their area of control.

3. **Trump's G7 and trade adviser is leaving the White House for a job in the private sector**. Kelly Ann Shaw announced that she will be leaving her posts as deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council. Shaw played a key role in leading the U.S. through the G7 and G20 and was part of the team advising Trump during trade talks between the U.S. and China. "It just felt like the right time to go for me," Shaw said. "I am ready for my next and new adventure." Shaw will leave her post on Friday.
