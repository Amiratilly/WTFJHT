1/ **Trump uses White House cellphones that lack the proper security features required to protect his communications**, potentially leaving him open to hacking or surveillance. Trump uses at least two different iPhones — one for making calls and one for Twitter and news — and has resisted efforts from his staff to beef up the security around his phone use. Aides have urged Trump to swap out his Twitter phone on a monthly basis, but Trump says it's "too inconvenient." Trump has gone as long as five months without having his phone checked by security experts. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/trump-phone-security-risk-hackers-601903))

2/ **White House employees who draft proposed tweets for Trump intentionally use bad grammar and incorporate spelling errors to make it sound like Trump is the one tweeting**. The overuse of exclamation points, random capitalization of words for emphasis, and use of fragmented sentences are all part of a process intended to make the tweets seem like genuine Trump communications.

3/ **Elliot Broidy received the largest U.S. government payout in the history of his company while he was selling access to Trump to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates**. In addition to securing nearly $1 billion in contracts from Saudi Arabia and the UAE in 2017 in exchange for lobbying against Qatar, Broidy and George Nader locked down more than $4 million in contracts from the Defense Department in August and September of the same year. The most Circinus LCC had  received in defense contracts prior to Broidy's lobbying work in Washington D.C. was $7,501.

4/ **The Supreme Court ruled for the first time in a 5-4 decision that private sector workers may not band together to challenge violations of federal labor laws**. In the majority opinion Justice Neil Gorsuch said that the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act trumps the National Labor Relations Act, meaning that employees who sign employee agreements to arbitrate claims must go through arbitration on an individual basis. Employees who sign arbitration agreements waive their rights to join a class action lawsuit, meaning they are not allowed to band together to challenge wage and hour violations.
